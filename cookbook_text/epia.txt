   PREFACE.  IN PUBLISHING this work I have endeavored to fill a much needed want, viz: -the best and most effectual manner of preparing healthy and nutritious food.  This edition contains innumerable recipes which I have simplified and explained in a comprehensive manner so as to meet the wants of all. It suggests, also, many useful and important hints to those about entering the profession.  The book is illustrated and contains instructions how to prepare, garnish and serve according to the traditional rules of our most able predecessors, and now followed by the principal chefs of France and the United States.  In some instances, where it was deemed necessary to differ from the standard rules and methods in order to cater to the various tastes, changes have been made.  The book is divided into twenty-four chapters: Table Service, Bills of Fare, Supplies, Elementary Methods, Soups, Stocks, Hot and Cold Sauces, Garnishings, Hot and Cold Side Dishes, Shell Fish, Crustaceans, Fish, Beef, Veal, Mutton, Lamb, Pork, Poultry, Game, Miscellaneous Entr&#233;es, Cold Dishes, Vegetables, Cereals, Hot and Cold Desserts, Pastry, Bakery, Confectionery, Ices, Fruit, Wines and Preserves.  Not relying solely on my experience and knowledge, I have quoted from the most illustrious modern author, my much beloved friend and colleague, Urbain Dubois, ex-chef at the Court of Germany, and it gives me sincere pleasure to thank him for his generous assistance.  The profession will acknowledge its indebtedness to the Messrs. Delmonico for the interest shown by them in developing the gastronomic art in this country.  Many will recall the business receptions given to distinguished guests under the supervision and direction of Delmonico.  Mention may be made of the following dinners: to President U. S. Grant, to President A. Johnson, to the Grand Duke Alexis of Russia, to Gen. Prim, to Charles Dickens, to Sir Morton Peto, to Aug. Belmont, to Giraud Foster, to Gen. Cutting, to Luckmeyer, the so-called "Black Swan Dinner," to Admiral Renaud, to Prof. Morse, to Bartholdi, to De Lesseps, to the Comte de Paris, also the ball given to the Russian Admiral and Fleet, and the Greek dinner.   I have entitled this work THE EPICUREAN, and have justly dedicated it to the memory of Messrs. Delmonico, as a token of my gratitude and sincere esteem.  Their world-wide reputation continues to be maintained by Mr. C. C. Delmonico.  In conclusion I feel that my experience will be useful to those seeking information in the gastronomic art.  Hoping the public will appreciate my efforts,  I remain respectfully,   CHARLES RANHOFER.

  DINNER SERVICE -AMERICAN STYLE -AND BILL OF FARE (Dinner Service &#224; l'Am&#233;ricaine et le Menu).  The success of a dinner depends upon good cooking, the manner in which it is served, and especially on entertaining congenial guests. The American service is copied more or less from the French and Russian, and remodeled to the tastes and customs of this country; as it varies somewhat from all others, a few instructions may be found useful to those desirous of learning the difference existing between them. 
  THE BILL OF FARE (MENU).  Menus are made for breakfasts, luncheons and suppers, but the most important one is for the dinner; these menus are generally composed a few days in advance to enable the necessary provisions to be purchased, so that on the day of the dinner, there has been ample time to prepare everything necessary, consequently much confusion is avoided and the work better done.  In carrying out the order the menu should be strictly followed, in fact, it must be an obligatory rule to do so.  Making out the bill of fare is the duty of the head cook, who composes and writes them according to the latitude he enjoys and the resources he has at hand.  
  BILLS OF FARE FOR DINNER.  Should the menu be intended for a dinner including ladies, it must be composed of light, fancy dishes with a pretty dessert; if, on the contrary, it is intended for gentlemen alone, then it must be shorter and more substantial. If the dinner be given in honor of any distinguished foreign guest, then a place must be allowed on the menu to include a dish or several dishes of his own nationality; avoid repeating the same names in the same menu. Let the gravies be of different colors, one following the other.  Also vary the color of the meats as far as possible, from one course to the other. Offer on the menus all foods in their respective seasons, and let the early products be of the finest quality (consult a general market list to find the seasonable produce), and only use preserved articles when no others can be obtained.  If the menus are hand written they must be very legible.  Menus are indispensable for service &#224; l'Am&#233;ricaine; there should be one for each guest, for as  no dish served from the kitchen appears on the table, every one must be informed beforehand of what the dinner is composed, and those dishes that are to follow each other.  Menus must be both simple and elegant, and of a size to allow them to be easily placed in the pocket without folding, as it is the general desire to keep the bill of fare of a dinner at which one has assisted.  A few important observations necessary to bills of fare and their classification are here given:  
  OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL.  Oysters appear on the menu the same as in the Russian service on French bills of fare they do not mention them. Suppress oysters in every month not containing the letter R, such as: May, June, July and August, and serve Little Neck clams instead.  
  SOUPS.  Soups are served after the oysters. One clear and one thick soup should be selected but if only one is needed, give the preference to the clear soup.  
  HORS-D'&#x152;UVRE, SIDE OR LIGHT DISHES.  Hot hors-d'&#x153;uvre are, generally, timbales, croustades, cromesquis, palmettes, mousselines, bouch&#233;es, cannelons, cassolettes, rissoles, etc. With the same course serve cold side dishes, such as olives, radishes, canap&#233;s, caviare, pickled tunny, anchovies, etc.  In the French service, the fish and the solid joints come under the head of relev&#233;s or removes. In the American and English service, first comes the fish, then the removes.  
  FISH.  If the fish be boiled or braized, add potatoes to the menu; if broiled or saut&#233;d, some cucumber salad; and, if fried, serve plain or with a light sauce.  
  REMOVES OR RELEV&#201;S.  The relev&#233;s or solid joints are composed of saddles, either of veal, mutton, lamb, venison and antelope, or else beef tenderloins or middle short loins. Turkey, goose, capon, pullets, ducks, etc., may be served, accompanied by one or two vegetables.  
  ENTR&#201;ES.  Place on the bill of fare first the heaviest entr&#233;e, and conclude with the lightest; they must be previously cut up so as to avoid carving. No fish figures in the American service as an entr&#233;e, but terrapin or crabs may be allowed; also lobsters, shrimps, frogs, croquettes, etc.  Each entr&#233;e should be accompanied by a vegetable, served separately, except when it is one of those described above, such as terrapin, etc.  
  PUNCH OR SHERBETS.  A punch or sherbet is always served after the entr&#233;es and before the roast; do not make an extra heading on the menu for these, only placing them on a line by themselves, for instance: Roman punch or American sherbet.  
  ROASTS.  Roasts are served after the sherbet; a game roast is usually preferred, but poultry, either truffled or not, may be substituted: such as turkey, capon, pullet, duck, guinea-fowl, squabs, etc.; also roasted butcher's meat; but game is usually considered to be more choice.  
  COLD DISHES.  Cold dishes come after the roast, and before the hot dessert; they are served with green salads; terrines of foies-gras and boned turkey are also served as a second roast. (In the French service these cold dishes are classified as the last entr&#233;e.)  
  HOT SWEET DISHES OR ENTREMETS.  These appear after the roast; they are composed of puddings, crusts, fried creams, fritters, pancakes, borders, omelets, and souffl&#233;es, and form a separate course by themselves.  
  COLD SWEET DISHES OR ENTREMETS.  The cold sweet entremets come after the hot and are composed of jellies, bavarois, creams, blanc-manges, mac&#233;doines, charlottes and large cakes, and form another course.  
  DESSERT.  After the cold entremets come the dessert, composed of cheese, fresh fruits, preserved fruits, cakes, jams, dried fruits, candied fruits, bonbons, mottoes, papillotes, victorias, pyramids, frozen puddings, plombi&#232;res, ices, ice cream and small fancy cakes, then the coffee and cordials.

 SERVICE OF WINES AND CORDIALS (Service des Vins et Liqueurs).  The steward must inform and specify to the butler the wine to be served at each separate course. However, important the dinner may be, still decanters of ordinary red and white wine must be placed on the table. The selection of the finer wines is the host's duty, he making his choice when ordering the bill of fare.  The steward's duty is to see that the wines are served at a proper temperature.  All white wines must be served cold.  Sherry and Xeres cool.  Bordeaux between 52 and 60 degrees, Fahrenheit, according to its growth.  Burgundy between 42 and 45 degrees.  Champagnes, cold or iced, or in sherbets.  Dessert wines cool.  For choosing wines consult the table on wines of Delmonico's cellar. (No. 3709.)

   THE DINNER TABLE, RECEPTION TABLE SERVICE AND WINES. (Le Couvert, R&#233;ception, Service de Table et les Vins.) 
  TABLE SERVICE FOR TWENTY-FOUR PERSONS.  An oblong shaped table is preferable for a large dinner party, the feet being less incommodious; it must at least be six or seven feet wide and twenty-two feet long, with rounded ends. This shaped table is most generally used, although some prefer round, or horse-shoe ones, or an oblong with square ends, and many other fanciful shapes, depending entirely on the size of the room and the taste of the host.  Tables can be lengthened according to the number of seats desired; the space allowed for each guest is, for a square, table with square ends, two feet apart between each plate; when the ends are curved, the space for the corners must be twenty-two inches apart, and if entirely round, twenty inches.  Cover a table twenty-two by seven with a felt cover made for the purpose, then over this lay a tablecloth twenty-four feet long and eight or nine feet wide, being careful that it is exceedingly white and smooth, having no creases whatever.  Fold a well starched, large napkin, pinch it triangularly, and place it in the center of the table; have twenty-four smaller napkins also well starched, folded and pinched, and place these at the edge of the table and on each one set a plate with another napkin on top, folded either shaped as a boat, a tulip, or any other pretty design, or else the napkin may be simply folded square.  The bread is placed either under the folds or in the center of the napkin, according to the manner in which it is displayed, or on a small plate to the left of the cover. Another way is to place the bread in front of the napkin.  On the left of each plate, lay a table fork and also a fish fork.  On the right set a table knife, a silver fish knife, a soup spoon, also a small fork for oysters or Little Neck  clams   In front, but slightly toward the right of each plate, set a small individual salt-cellar. The double silver pepper castors containing black and red pepper are distributed two on each side, and two at each end of the table, with eight single ones between the double ones.  Glasses are placed in a semi-circle either in front of the plate or else on the right; arrange these according to the courses to be served. First, water glass; second, white wine; third, sherry; fourth, Rhine wine; fifth, champagne; and sixth, Bordeaux.  Before serving the entr&#233;es remove the white wine, Sherry and Rhine wine glasses and replace them by fine Bordeaux and Burgundy glasses. Glasses intended for dessert wines and liquors, are only put on the table with the dessert.  
  THE CENTER LINE OF THE TABLE.  In the center of the table have a large piece of silverware decorated with plants, ferns and natural flowers, or else a high vase or simply a basket of flowers. These baskets or other decorations may be filled with one, or several kinds of variegated flowers, mingling red and white, scarlet and lilac, or Parma violets, or tulips and orchids, these produce a brilliant effect. (The entire house, staircases, halls, etc., may also be decorated with plants, palms, lemon and orange trees, or rubber plants. Mantels and mirrors to be also wreathed with flowers, or else scattered about in clusters, and have hanging baskets tastefully arranged in prominent corners, so as to add to the general beautiful effect.)  On each side of the center piece and on the center line have two prettily arranged baskets containing seasonable or hot-house fruits; on each side of these, set an ornamental piece, either made of nougat, gum-paste or sugar candy, or should these high pieces not be desirable, others may be substituted either of bronze, or else stands covered with flowers, etc.  On each end of these pieces set either candelabras or lamps, and beyond these high stands of graduated tiers filled with bonbons, cornucopias, Victorias, bonbon boxes, etc., all of them forming the center line of the table. Around this line, and at about twenty to twenty-four inches from the edge, draw a line the same shape as the table, and on this place decanter stands for decantered wine; two for sherry, four for white wine, and four for red Bordeaux, making ten in all, and the same quantity of decanter stands for decanters containing water, or instead of ten, twenty-four smaller ones may be substituted, one for each person.  Place at intervening spaces, two compote dishes with stewed fruits, four stands for small fancy cakes, two compote dishes for candied or dried fruits, nuts, etc., or else fresh strawberries, raspberries or mulberries, if in season, a saucerful for each person, and finish by interlacing through these dishes as well as the decanters, strings of smilax or any other pretty creeping vine,  following around about twenty-four inches from the edge of the table; set into this verdure at various parts, clusters of natural flowers. A table arranged according to this description will be found to have a most charming and pleasing effect.  The diagram of the table should be obtained, and have the names of each guest tastefully written on fancy cards; lay one of these on the right hand glass of each person, in a prominent manner so that it can be read from a distance which will greatly facilitate the seating of the guests. Procure bouquets of flowers for the ladies, set in fancy vases, tying them with ribbons, and having a pin attached to enable them to fasten them on to their dresses; gentlemen's button-hole bouquets should also be placed in vases. All these flowers must be in front, but slightly toward the left of each person.  The bills of fare or menus should be placed on the left side, either in silver stands (Fig. 197), or set beside the plate.  The host should always be seated so as to face the door leading into the dining-room. The hostess on the other end of the table directly opposite, their respective seats being at the top and bottom of the table. The seat of honor for a lady is on the right hand of the host, and naturally on the right hand of the hostess for a gentleman. The left hand may also be utilized as seats of honor but of minor importance. A dining room should be kept at a comfortable temperature. The sideboard should be placed at one side of the table, and on this or in the drawers and compartments everything must be arranged in thorough order so as to have them handy, thus avoiding all confusion during dinner.  The entire dessert service including wines to be arranged tastefully on the sideboard, giving a very pretty effect to the room. A service table must either be in the dining-room behind a screen or in a pantry close by; it must contain one or several carving boards, sundry knives and forks, ladles, chafing dishes, etc. The service must be rapid and the dishes served hot; avoid having anything cooked in advance except the large pieces. Entr&#233;es and all smaller dishes should be prepared according to their successive order, as the dinner progresses, at an interval of two or three courses, which means about ten or twenty minutes apart. A good steward can always manage to protract the dinner in case the cook is behind time, but it is his duty to inform those in the kitchen at least ten minutes beforehand so as to prevent any possible delay; he must also have a duplicate bill of fare from the kitchen identical with the one on the table, and classified according to the service, so as to be able to consult it in order to know exactly which dish follows the other.  When the dinner is ready, the steward must place his help in their respective positions, and give them final instructions regarding their duties; they should be attired in dress suits, white ties and gloves, and wear no jewelry whatever. In order to serve a ceremonial dinner for twenty-four persons, it will require: a steward, a butler, a carver and six waiters; carefully intrusting the care of the wines to the most intelligent, and the carving to the most expert; the remaining six being for the special table service, they must remain in their respective places to be at the call of the guests should their services be required.  
  RECEPTION.  The gentlemen are to be received by a waiter, who before introducing them into the reception room, takes their overcoats, canes, hats, umbrellas, etc., leaving these articles in a place set aside for this purpose, near the reception room, then hands each gentleman an envelope addressed to himself in which there will be found a card bearing the name of the lady he is to escort to the dining-room, and who is to be seated on his right hand during dinner.  Two other waiters attired in full dress, introduce the gentlemen into the reception room adjoining the dining-room, the doors to the latter being closed; in the reception room there should be a small Russian buffet, or simply serve some sherry, Xeres, bitters, vermuth and absinthe, to be handed round on trays to each guest as he arrives.  It is absolutely necessary to have a lady's maid to receive the ladies, lay aside their outer garments, or any article they may desire to confide to her care; these must be arranged in such a manner as to be easily returned to their respective owners.  The maid must remain and wait, in order to be continually at the disposal of the lady guests.  When all the invited guests have arrived and been duly introduced, the dinner hour having struck, the steward opens the dining-room doors, bows to the host, this being the signal to announce that dinner is served.  The hostess enters the dining-room first, on the arm of the gentleman in whose honor the dinner is given, followed by the other guests, the host being last. Each one sits down at the seats indicated on the cards, and when all are comfortably seated the dinner begins.   The service must be performed silently, a look alone from the steward sufficing for each man to do his duty. Every article handed round must be on a silver salver.  
  THE SERVICE.   Oysters.  -Little Neck clams are passed around, beginning on one side by the lady on the right and the other side by the gentleman on the right, these being the most distinguished guests; change this method at each course, those being served last before, being the first now.  The butler will pour out the Chablis, stating the name of each wine he serves.   Soup.  -There are usually two soups to select from. While serving green turtle offer at the same time lemon cut in quarters.  Sherry should be served with this course.   Side Dishes.  -Pass hot hors-d'&#x153;uvre; these are served on warm plates. Serve the cold hors d'&#x153;uvre at the same time, and should the guest prefer the latter, remove the hot plate at once and substitute a cold one for it.  Sherry or Xeres should accompany this course.   Fish.  -If there be two kinds of fish, offer the selection, and pass round the one preferred; should it be boiled or braized fish, have potatoes served at the same time; if broiled or saut&#233;d thinly sliced seasoned fresh cucumbers must accompany it, and if fried fish such as whitebait, serve with thin slices of buttered brown bread and quarters of lemon.  Serve Rhine wine or white Bordeaux.   Removes or Solid Joints.  -The removes may be placed on the table before being taken off for carving; if it be a saddle of venison, it should be cooked rare, passing currant jelly at the same time. A saddle of mutton must also be rare and very hot; it can be cut lengthwise at an angle in thin slices or across, although the first way is preferable; serve both these on very hot plates, and have one or two vegetables accompanying them.  Serve champagne.   Entr&#233;es.  -The entr&#233;es must be served one after the other without placing them on the table beforehand; they must be served on hot plates with one vegetable for each entree, to be either passed round separately or else carefully laid on the same plate, unless it is desired that they be dressed; in this case dress and present to each guest. Serve Bordeaux at the first entr&#233;e, and an extra quality of wine at the last; continue serving champagne to those who prefer to drink it until the roast.  
  INTERVAL. -SECOND SERVICE.   Iced Punch or Sherbet.  -Should there be no ladies present, cigarettes can be handed round at the same time. Remove the two white wine and sherry glasses, and replace them by those used for Burgundy, also remove the cold side dishes. Ten to fifteen minutes must now be allowed between the courses.   Roasts.  -The roast may be displayed on the table before carving, this being frequently requested by epicures; should there be several roasts, carve them all at the same time and pass them round according to desire, adding a little watercress for poultry, and should there be canvas-back duck, let currant jelly and fried hominy be served with also a mayonnaise of celery.  Serve the Burgundy from bottles laid flat in baskets (Fig. 774.) holding the basket in the right hand and a white napkin in the left.   Cold.  -Serve the cold dishes after the roast, these to be either goose livers (foies-gras) with truffles or boned turkey. The foies-gras must have a spoon to remove it with, and the boned turkey be cut into thin slices, and offer both to the guest at the same time, accompanied by green salads.  Serve Johannisberg or Vin de Paille.  Now remove everything from the table with the exception of the dessert, and to avoid using a brush lift up the extra napkins in front of each person, folding them in two so that the table is neat and clean without being obliged to use a brush or scraper. Lay the dessert plates on the table, and continue the service for the hot dessert.   Hot Sweet Entremets.  -Make a distinct service for the hot entremets, then serve the cheese.  Serve a fine Laffitte Bordeaux.   Cold Sweet Entremets.  -Make another service for the cold entremets and ices.   Dessert.  -Instead of serving the cheese after the hot entremets it may be done now, which is in fact its proper place; pass around the fresh fruits, stewed, candied and dried fruits, bonbon cases, bonbons, mottoes, ices, strawberries and raspberries with cream when in season, passing cakes around at the same time.   Serve Madeira wine, Muscatel and Frontignan, also plates of salted almonds.  
  THE CONCLUSION OF THE DINNER.  It is now time for the hostess to bow, push back her chair and prepare to rise, this being a signal for the ladies to retire; after they have returned to the drawing-room, coffee is passed round on a salver containing spoons, hot water, sugar and cream. A few moments later another waiter comes forward with an empty tray to remove the cups the ladies hand him.  The gentlemen partake of their coffee in the dining-room; at the same time serve them Kirsch, brandy, chartreuse, cigars and cigarettes. The doors are closed and the ladies and waiters have retired so as to allow the gentlemen more freedom to talk among themselves, still it will be necessary to enter the drawing room and dining-room occasionally in order to see whether anything be needed so as to avoid being called as much as possible.  After half an hour or so, the gentlemen will rejoin the ladies in the drawing-room and then tea is served. The tea service is accomplished by passing around on trays, tea, sugar, hot water, cream, cups, spoons and slices of lemon. A few moments later another waiter removes the empty cups on a tray.  After the tea the service is considered to be ended.

 FRENCH SERVICE (Service &#224; la Fran&#231;aise).  There are two different services in use: The French and the Russian.  Although recognizing the priority of both of these services, it will be well to mention the difference existing between them and the English and the American service; first, they differ in the classification of the bills of fare and certain changes in the table service, these alone are sufficient to be interesting.  The old style of French service threatens to disappear entirely and is rarely used, except on very rare occasions.  The three services placed on the table, one after the other, had certainly the advantage of displaying the culinary labor as well as the most variegated and rare products by exhibiting them in all their profuseness. But the great inconvenience is the preparation of dishes beforehand in the kitchen in order to have each service ready at once and to keep them hot in heaters before beginning to serve the dinner.  The dishes for the first course are placed on the table in chafing dishes provided with covers, to be lifted off when the guests are seated, and left on the table till ready to be carved.  Of course this inconvenience is somewhat remedied by keeping the heaters and chafing dishes at a given heat, and there must be placed near the table, either behind a screen in the dining-room or else in an adjoining pantry, a bain-marie with all the necessary sauces required for the dinner, and as soon as the meats are carved, each one is to be covered with its respective sauce before being handed around.  But notwithstanding all possible care and attention the entr&#233;es are apt to lose much of their finer qualities by the very act of being cooked and dressed beforehand, then kept hot in these heaters or chafing dishes.  Still this could scarcely have been the sole cause for abandoning the old system, for it continued in usage for several centuries. We are, however, obliged to recognize that first-class families have ceased to make a display of the great luxuriousness indulged in, in the past; to-day they are more restrained, the help less numerous and the chief cook frequently alone with one kitchen assistant, having no longer an extra man for pastry, confectionery and ices. The chef himself must see to the preparation of the pastry, ices and desserts. There are now scarcely to be found any house where for twelve persons they employ a chef, an assistant and a pastry cook and the remainder of the help corresponding to this great amount of luxury.  The bills of fare are simpler; instead of dressing and arranging the service on the table itself, many houses have a mixed service; this is made by presenting the dishes on the table, then removing them to be carved.  The general desire of the day is to dine quicker; taste changes with the fashion. The old French service is fast disappearing, and as it becomes more simple it gradually evolves into a mixed Russian and French service.  
  FRENCH SERVICE FOR 24 PERSONS (Service &#224; la Fran&#231;aise pour 24 Couverts).  The first service is composed of hors-d'&#x153;uve (side dishes), two soups, two removes, four hot entr&#233;es, or two cold and two hot entr&#233;es.  Remove the cold hors-d'&#x153;uvre; serve the punch or sherbet.  The second service is composed of two roasts to take the place of the removes; four entremets, two being of vegetables, one hot sweet entremets and one cold; these to replace the entr&#233;es; two entremets cakes to take the place of the cold entr&#233;es.  Prepare the table for the dessert.  The third service, or dessert, is composed of two shelved stands filled with bonbons, victorias, bonbon boxes, cossacks, two low stands or drums containing small fancy cakes, two basketfuls of fresh fruits, two assorted compotes, one orange jelly, one bar-le-due jelly and two cheeses; two fancy pieces of nougat or candied sugar to replace the entremets cakes.  The wines should be selected and served as indicated in another chapter, according to the taste and desire of the host.  
  FRENCH SERVICE, DINNER FOR 24 PERSONS -TO SET THE TABLE (Service &#224; la Fran&#231;aise, D&#238;ner de 24 Couverts -Le Couvert).  The table must be sixteen to eighteen feet long and six to seven feet wide, with rounded corners, covered with a table-cloth and having exactly in the center a high stand or epergne, or piece of silverware or bronze, filled with flowers. Continue the middle line with candelabras or lamps; leave a place for the chafing dishes and between these arrange the cold hors-d'&#x153;uvre. Set the plates, the glasses to form a semicircle in front; the spoons and knives on the right and the forks on the left.  Commence serving the most honored guest on each right side, and begin each separate service at the person served the last.  All the dishes intended for the table should be dressed tastefully and the edges decorated with open-worked noodle borders; the meats laid symmetrically, the borders to be neither too high nor too much spread so that the dish covers can fit on easily; light bread borders can also be used.  Decorate the meats with trimmed hatelets just before placing them on the table.  
  NECESSARY MATERIAL FOR 24 PERSONS (Mat&#233;riel N&#233;cessaire pour 24 Couverts).  Let the china, glassware, silver, cutlery and linen be as much alike as possible, have the glasses all plain or cut of the same pattern and shape; the china either all white, colored or gilt; the linen plain or damasked with large or small designs.  The plates must be changed at each service as well as the knives and forks, they must be  washed immediately and used again for the following services, otherwise there will be as many knives and forks needed as plates, consequently far more material.   24 soup plates.  24 side-dish plates.  72 dinner plates.  48 dessert plates.  24 soupspoons.  24 coffee after-dinner cups.  24 dessert knives and forks.  72 large forks.  72 steel knives.  24 silver or gilt knives.  24 side-dish knives and forks.  24 coffeespoons   Small salt cellars and pepper casters, one for each person.   12 radish dishes for 24 persons.

 RUSSIAN SERVICE (Service &#224; la Russe).  The habit we have of eating everything very hot and very fast comes to us from the "Russian service;" it differs from the French service in the very fact that nothing hot appears on the table, everything is cut up as needed, either in the kitchen or pantry. The carving should be performed  very neatly, having all the pieces of even size and placed at once symmetrically either in a circle or straight row on dishes for ten or less persons, then passed round to the guests, who help themselves or are helped, according to their wish.  For the solid joints, removes or roasts, they can be served precisely the same, or else laid on very hot plates and handed directly to each guest. There must be a sufficiency of every kind of entr&#233;e to serve for every person present. Should there be several and a variety of roasts and only one service required, then carve a third part of each one, or more of one than the other if certain dishes seem to be preferred. If there be several removes the same course can be pursued. As soon as one course is being passed around, the following one should be brought from the kitchen so that the dinner can be served uninterruptedly and eaten while hot and palatable.  The cold meat pieces may be dressed and arranged on the table the same as the candelabras, silverware, bronze vases and flower baskets, all of these to be in the center line of the table, leaving eighteen inches of space uncovered between the end of the line and the edge of the table; between this center line and the edge draw a round or oval or any other desirable shape at eighteen inches above the edge. If there be two cold meat pieces lay them on the sides of the table and in the center of the line, and if four, then two at the sides and two at the ends in the center, if eight then have four at the corners between the sides and ends on the eighteen-inch line above the edge; finish to decorate this line with cold sweet dishes, baskets of fresh fruits, shelved stands filled with bonbons, cossacks, Victorias, drums containing small fancy cakes, compoted dried fruits, etc., all these ornaments give the table a charming effect and should be arranged before the guests enter the dining-room.  The straight line alone and the cold meat pieces can be also arranged, finishing at eighteen inches from the edge with garlands of leaves and flowers instead of the dessert, and when ready to serve the cold pieces, take them off and replace them by the taller desserts, shelved stands and drums, ranging the others here and there, half on either side of the table between the middle line and the flowers.  Hot sweet entremets are always served as extras or "flying dishes," after the vegetables.  The service is far less sumptuous and elegant than the French one, yet it pleases many and is very fashionable at the present time. The remainder of the service is exactly like the French.  The old-fashioned bills of fare for the Russian service were classed differently to those of to-day; further on they will be found in great variety, appertaining to different epochs and a selection can be made of those most suitable; the service remains invariably the same, the only change being in the bill of fare.  It is the custom in Russia to serve the iced punches or sherbets after the fish, but it is certainly preferable to wait until the entr&#233;es are removed.  
  SUPPER. (Le Souper.)  "To sleep easily one must sup lightly."  
  SUPPER BUFFET.  Supper buffets are dressed on tables twelve to twenty feet long by four to five feet wide; larger or smaller according to the number of guests and the richness of the bill of fare. Be careful that every article on the table shows to the best advantage, arranging each dish in a tasteful manner, yet observing certain indispensable rules so to facilitate the service that the buffet can be replenished and the dishes removed without the slightest confusion. The warm dishes should be served continuously without any delay and only a few at the time. Place a large piece of silverware in the center of the table to contain fruits, following the middle line on the length, then two large baskets of flowers and two pieces either of nougat or sugar, both ornamented with candied fruits, then two large cold-meat pieces and two stands filled with bonbon boxes, mottoes, victorias and bonbons, afterward two candelabras, and two entremets cakes to finish. In the front place a decorated salmon, behind on the other side of the center line stand the tenderloin of beef, and on each side of the fish and tenderloin, two medium-sized meat pieces, then the drums or high stands filled with small cakes. After this the small cold entr&#233;es, such as sandwiches and small rolls filled with rillettes; at each end of the table arrange the chicken and lobster salads. On one end of the table have plenty of material handy (according to the importance of the bill of fare), for hot service; have plates, soup tureens and chafing-dishes; behind, near the tenderloin of beef, put the ices, jellies and charlottes.  These suppers are usually served after the first part of the dancing order is finished between  eleven o'clock and one in the morning. Frequently small tables are used when there is sufficient room; these are generally reserved for the ladies.  
  HOT DISHES.  First part. -The soup is either consomm&#233; in cups, or barley cream, or rice and almond milk. These must be perfectly clear in order to serve them in cups the same as the consomm&#233;.

There are a great variety of elegant entr&#233;es, and among others the following ones may be selected:  Aspics of all kinds, red beef tongue, foies-gras, fillets of chickens, oysters, etc.; white and brown chaufroids of partridge and chicken, also ravigote ducks, galantines of chicken, cream of pigeons, squabs and quails covered with chaufroid and decorated with black truffles and very green pistachio nuts; smoked and unsmoked tongue well glazed and dressed pyramid form; lamb chops au vert pr&#233;, ballotines of quails and squabs, ducklings pear shaped and thrushes &#224; la P&#233;rigord; terrines of N&#233;rac and ducks' livers &#224; la Toulouse and young rabbit &#224; la mode de Rouen; pains of chicken or game. Entr&#233;es of larks and reedbirds, chicken mayonnaise; lobster, shrimp, crab and salmon salads, also salad &#224; la Russe, and at equal distances have plates of small breads garnished with rillettes and fine sandwiches.

This third part of the menu is certainly the prettiest and most coquettish, and with these luxuries ends the selection of dishes from which an elegant table may be set.   Drinks.  -Champagne, Bordeaux, Burgundy, wine punches, lemonades, grenadine and syrups of raspberry, currant or orgeat, coffee or tea.  
  AMBIGU.  A meal usually offered cold without any soup, and set on a table where removes are served at the same time, also entr&#233;es, side dishes and sweet desserts, and in which the service is blended into one, for no dishes are to be removed. Certain breakfast, hunting luncheons, and suppers served in the midst of a ball, are also all called ambigu.  
 
  SERVICE FOR LUNCHEONS.  Lunch is a small repast indulged in between breakfast and dinner. This meal is called lunch in English, in French go&#251;ter or taste, because it is less heavy than the others, and, as generally very little is eaten, it is only tasted. In France this old custom only exists in country towns where breakfast is very matinal; the English and Americans also lunch, for they breakfast early and only dine toward six or seven o'clock, therefore lunch is an indispensable meal with them. Larger and more ceremonious luncheons are frequently served; these are called "dinner luncheons," and many bills of fare for their preparation will be found later on. For family luncheons there are generally served cold meats, light entr&#233;es, sandwiches, pastries, ices, preserves, etc.,  
 
  LUNCHEON FOR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, OR FOR LADIES ONLY, OR GENTLEMEN ONLY.  FOR LADIES ONLY.  Although set with more simplicity than the dinner table, nothing elegant must be lacking; in the center of the table place a flower decoration, either a double cornicopia, or a boat, or two dossers set back to back, or a vase, or a temple, etc., according to the reason the lunch was offered to the guests. On each side place a piece made of nougat, one of spun sugar, and at each end a high stand on tiers filled with bonbons, Victorias, mottoes, etc.  At eighteen or twenty-four inches from the edge, according to the width of the table, draw a line the same shape as the table and lay on this decanters of white and sherry wines, also water decanters, one for every two persons; two fruit dishes, four containing small fancy cakes, and two of dried fruits. Set semicircular around each plate as many glasses as there are wines; on the right hand lay a card bearing the name of the guest, and on the left a dress or buttonhole bouquet and the menu standing against the flower vase. Decorate the sideboard with the dessert service; carve the meats near the dining-room, and see that everything is served very hot. Let the wines be of a proper temperature, and specify each one while serving it; as soon as everything is in complete order, open the doors and bow, which means that the lunch is ready, and the guests may assemble in the dining-room to take their places at the seats designated on their cards. The service begins the same as the dinner and continues likewise until the coffee is served, when the ladies retire to the drawing-room to partake of theirs, to listen to music, or to withdraw unceremoniously.  If the lunch should be intended for gentlemen only, suppress all ornamentation except the flowers and fruits; the menu should be more substantial, and if for ladies and gentlemen together, serve the same as for a dinner, observing the same etiquette.  
  MEAT BREAKFAST (D&#233;jeuner &#224; la Fourchette).  A meat breakfast is composed of broiled meats, cold meat, fish, eggs, croustades, fried dishes, sweets and dessert.  BILL OF FARE.

  SWEET ENTREMETS AND DESSERT.  If so far no eggs have been mentioned in the bill of fare, then fruit or spirituous omelets of all kinds may be served, or else Celestine omelet, snow souffl&#233;, etc., but in case eggs have already been used, then diversify the bill of fare by giving fritters, crusts, pancakes, pears, apples, peaches, etc. Have also pies, tarts and cakes as well as cheese and fresh fruit.  Coffee and Liquors.  
  THE BREAKFAST TABLE.  The breakfast table must be laid simpler, although with as much care and taste as for all other meals; naturally there is less ceremony to be observed for a breakfast, the simplicity of the bill of fare and wines rendering it far easier to serve. The hors-d'&#x153;uvre and fruit may be placed on the table, and when a dressy appearance is desired, flowers or high cold pieces, such as meat pies, chaufroids, aspics, trout or salmon, may also be added.  The service for the wines and cooking is exactly the same as for a dinner.  
 
  SUPPLIES (Approvisionnements).  Good cooking is only obtained by having all the ingredients healthy, appetizing and nutritious; the stomach must not be fatigued, and yet the eye and the palate have to be somewhat flattered. A dish may be more or less simple, more or less difficult, but it must satisfy the taste and to obtain this result a cook should only use the best materials and those of the very freshest.  All the supplies should be of the very first choice; the best cook in the world can fail to work properly unless the provisions are of the best. A cook anxious to perform his duty must pay the strictest attention to the selection of the food; this alone constitutes a science based on a deep knowledge and long practice.  Beef must have light red, marbled meat, the fat being firm to the touch.  Veal meat to be white and firm, also its fat.  Mutton has red meat firm and marbled, the fat to be white.  Pork must be carefully selected from pigs raised on acorns or corn, having firm, white meat, and firm, white, brittle fat.  Chickens to be plump, the breast bone flexible, the ribs easily cracked. Pinch the pinion bones to see whether they are tender; the same of turkeys, other poultry and game. Old fowls can never replace young chickens, therefore use them as little as possible. A fish is to have a clear, fresh eye and must be firm to the touch; mistrust it as soon as the belly flesh becomes soft; the smell will indicate whether it be fresh or stale; the same of crustaceans.  Vegetables to be selected of the very freshest.  Fruits by their appearance and taste.  TABLE OF SUPPLIES.

The heading of each recipe being in English and in French permits any person not thoroughly versed in both these languages to compose his bill of fare in either the one or the other. He has simply to make his selection of the necessary recipe and by referring to the number of the article, write his bill of fare in English or in French as he so chooses. In wording a dinner bill of fare be very careful to denote the fish or shell fish, the butcher's meat, the poultry and game in season, alternating white or brown for each course, also the white or brown sauces. I have as far as practicable replaced the term fillet by breasts for poultry or game and aiguillettes for fish, so that the word fillet need not be too frequently repeated in the same bill of fare. Oysters can be omitted from the bills of fare, also cold side dishes, salads and coffee, besides the details of the dessert following the entremets need only be mentioned by the single word of dessert.  
 
   ELEMENTARY METHODS. 
  
  (1). BURNT ALMONDS AND PILBERTS  (Amandes et Avelines Pralin&#233;es). 
Split some shelled  almonds or filberts  in two; if  almonds  are used mince well and roast lightly in the oven, on a baking sheet without letting them color, then mix in with them half their weight of  sugar  and enough  egg-white,  so they be entirely covered by the  sugar.  When the burnt  almonds  are spread on cakes, they must be covered over with  sugar  and glazed in a brisk oven.  
  
  (2). COND&#201; ALMOND OR FILBERT PREPARATION (Appareil &#224; Cond&#233; aux Amandes ou Aux Avelines). 
Put into a vessel three ounces of  powdered sugar,  one ounce of  vanilla sugar,  four ounces of icing  sugar.  Dilute this compound gradually with  egg-whites,  in such a manner that a smooth running  paste  is obtained, and beat it well for several minutes, so that it becomes a consistent body. To this add six ounces of dry  almonds or filberts,  shelled, ground or chopped up very fine.  
  
  (3). TO CHOP AND SHRED ALMONDS.  (Pour Hacher et Effiler les Amandes). 
 Chopped.  -When the  almonds  are partly dry, chop them up and sift them through a sieve ( Fig.  94), chop again all that remains on the sieve and continue until there be no more to pass through.   Shredded  Almonds.   -Are freshly peeled  almonds  dried well in a cloth, then cut into thin fillets on their length, or else put them into a special machine that shreds them also, but they never look so well, as the machine cuts them into all sorts of shapes, while with the knife, they are cut into uniform lengths.  
  
  (4). ALMOND MILK  (Lait d'Amandes). 
Pound half a pound of  almonds  with a few spoonfuls of  cold water  and two spoonfuls of  orange-flower water;  prepare a very fine  paste  with this and dilute with a pint of  water;  strain the liquid forcibly through a napkin.  
  
  (5). TO PEEL ALMONDS, PISTACHIOS OR FILBERTS  (Pour Monder les Amandes, Pistaches ou Avelines). 
In order to remove the peels from  almonds,   filberts  or  pistachio nuts,  they must first be plunged into  boiling water  and left on the fire until the  skin  detaches easily under the pressure of the finger, then drain and refresh in  cold water;  now drain and peel them by removing the  skins  wash in  cold water,  drain, wipe and dry in the heater or in a well aired place.   For  Filberts  or  Nuts.   -To be peeled dry, crack the shells with a  nut -cracking machine, being careful not to break the kernel, then peel them dry by putting the  nuts  on a baking sheet and pushing it into a medium oven, removing them immediately the outer  skin  detaches when the  nut  is rubbed between the thumb and first finger; keep them either whole or in halves and use for ice  cream  and desserts. Those peeled in  water  are for chopping, or splitting in two for nougats, also for cooked  sugar  pastes.  
  
  (6). TO POUND, CRUSH, AND COLOR ALMONDS  (Pour Piler Broyer et Colorer les Amandes). 
 To Pound.  - Almonds are pounded in a mortar or crushed in a machine; in the mortar by wetting a few at the time with either  eggs  or liquids, then stirring in some  sugar.  In a machine, by mixing the  almonds and sugar  together and pouring it into the funnel of the machine; the first time they should be barely crushed, pass through four times, tightening the cylinders slightly for each turn, and the last time the  almonds  should be reduced to a  paste.    To Color  Almonds.   -Use chopped or shredded  almonds  for coloring. For pink, dilute a little carmine in some thirty degree  syrup  with a little kirsch; rub the  almonds  in this and dry them. For violet, use red, blue and maraschino; for  orange,  yellow, red and cura&#231;ao; for lemon color, yellow and  noyau;  and for green,  spinach  and  orange flower water.   
 
  
  (7). TO BLANCH RICE  (Pour Blanchir le Riz). 
Before blanching  rice  it should be picked, washed, then put into a saucepan and moistened with  cold water;  bring the liquid to boiling point, stirring it frequently with a spoon so it does not adhere to the bottom of the saucepan, and let it boil for seven or eight minutes, pour the  rice  into a sieve to drain, refresh in  cold water  and strain.  
  
  (8). TO BLANCH VEGETABLES  (Pour Blanchir les L&#233;gumes). 
Vegetables are blanched in more or less time according to their nature, and not only to correct their bitterness, but to soften them as well; the blanching is the prologue of the cooking and is accomplished in boiling,  salted water,  either in a saucepan, a tinned copper pan, a copper untinned pan, or an untinned saucepan. In the copper and untinned pans, only the green vegetables should be cooked, such as  spinach,   green peas,  string  beans , fresh  asparagus,  in fact all vegetables that must retain a pretty, pale green color.  Artichokes  should be cooked in a very clean well-tinned saucepan. To blanch  parsley,   chervil,   tarragon,   onions,   shallots,  etc., plunge them in  boiling water  several times.  
  
  (9). TO BONE POULTRY OR GAME  (Pour D&#233;osser la Volaille et le Gibier). 
Poultry or  game  are generally boned in order to stuff them properly; they must first be singed lightly, the  legs  cut off as well as the pinions and  neck,  keeping the  skin  of the latter as long as possible; split the  skin  right along the back so as to free the carcass on both sides, using a small knife for this purpose, afterward separate the stump from each  wing,  so as to reach the fillets. When the fore-part of the belly is detached, separate also the  thighs  by dislocating them at the first joint adhering to the carcass, then  bone  the fleshy part of the  thighs  and the  drum -sticks. Cut the carcass down as far as the  rump,  so as to detach it entirely, and if these instructions are strictly followed, the piece of poultry or  game  will be found to be entirely boned, and the only parts now to be removed are the stumps of the  wings  and the large nerve found in the flesh of the  thighs,  and detach from the carcass the two minion fillets from which you remove the nerves.  
  
  (10). DISH BORDERS OF NOODLE PASTE, COOKED PASTE, METAL, ENGLISH PASTE OR GUM PASTE, DISH BOTTOMS, FOUNDATIONS, SUPPORTS, TRIANGLE FOR DRESSING TONGUES, HATELETS FOR HOT REMOVES AND ENTREES, FANCY FRILLS, AND FAVOR FRILLS  (Bordures de Plat en Nouilles P&#226;te Cuite, et en M&#233;tal, P&#226;te Anglaise et Pastillage, Fonds de Plats et Supports, Cro&#251;ton Triangle pour Dresser les Langues, H&#226;telets pour Relev&#233;s et Entr&#233;es Chauds, Bouffettes et Manchettes). 
Several kinds of borders are used in the kitchen for the purpose of decorating dishes; those most employed are cut out with a pastry cutter from a band of noodle  paste  (No. 142.) To make noodle  paste  borders requires ingenuity, although it is not difficult. First it needs a good noodle  paste  of a fine color and very smooth; divide it in several parts and roll these into  sausage  shapes, then flatten down with a rolling pin drawing them out to a sufficient length so the band can reach all around the basin of the dish; then cut these bands into the desired width keeping them exceedingly straight; roll them over on themselves without pressing, then unroll slowly on to a  paper  band to design them with a cutter ( Fig.  1), rolling up the cut out end as soon as finished to prevent the  paste  from drying; they may also be molded in molds shown in  Fig.  2. 
   FIG. 1   An illustration of a pattern used in making Noodle Paste Borders.  
   FIG. 2   An illustration of a pattern used in making Noodle Paste Borders.  
 To fasten the border onto the dish, push a string of rep&#232;re (No. 142) through a cornet around the basin of the dish exactly where the border is to stand upright; place the dish on top of a cool part of the range and unroll the cut-out band speedily onto the rep&#232;re to fasten it on in an upright position, attach the two ends together, then bend the band outward with the fingers to give it sufficient splay, turning it around all the time until it is dry enough to stand by itself, then cover over to prevent the border from drying.  Another style of border ( Fig.  3) greatly admired is made of cooked  white paste  (No. 131) also carved out with the pastry cutter, but under more simple conditions and is more resisting. These are very appropriate for entr&#233;es having an abundance of garnishing or a plentiful supply of  gravy,  thereby requiring a more resisting substance than noodle  paste.  This kind can be seen in the   different entr&#233;es illustrated in this work, but more specially in the figure representing a  chicken  &#224; la Montesquieu ( Fig.  372). But a style even more used and certainly far more practical is a border made of metal ( Figs.  4-5-6); they are fit to be served at a family dinner as well as at the most luxurious banquet in which the dishes are invariably handed round to the guests, for instance those viands dressed in the kitchen. These borders are movable and should be made the same size as the basin of the dish for which it is intended. These borders are of sterling silver, but they can be imitated in plated ware; let it be well understood that these borders can only be placed on metal, silver or plated dishes. 
  FIG. 3, FIG. 4, FIG. 5, FIG. 6.   Illustrations of Different Borders for Dishes made up of Metals.  
  For Borders of English  Paste  or Gum  Paste.   -Roll out the  paste  to the desired thickness and with a fancy cutter ( Fig.  6A) cut out some pieces and dry them on an even surface covered with  paper;  when finished place them in closed boxes in a dry place and when ready to use push a string of royal icing on the edge of the basin of the dish or platform and dress the border very evenly around. 
   FIG. 6A.  An illustration of a Nice Pattern used in Making Borders of Gum paste.  
  Dish Bottoms, Foundations and Supports.  -These foundations or dish bottoms serve for dressing pieces, removes or entr&#233;es, so to raise them and give them a more elegant appearance. They are to be made either of  bread,   rice,   hominy,  wood or tin. Round ones for entr&#233;es and ovals for removes for large roasts. The height for entr&#233;es is about one and a half inches, while for removes they are to be two inches; those of wood or tin are to be covered with noodle  paste,  those of  rice  or  hominy  are sculptured or carved with a knife. 
  FIG. 7, FIG. 8.   Illustrations of Different Dish Bottoms.  
  Molded supports are to be prepared for boned  turkeys,   capon,  pullet, etc.; these are of an oblong shape, rounded at the ends (See  Fig.  9A.); the longest ones intended for  turkey's  are nine and a quarter inches long by four and three quarters wide and two and a quarter high; for  capons  they are to be nine inches long, four and a half wide and two inches high; for  tenderloins of beef,  ten inches long by four wide and two and a half high; for  hams,  they are oval shaped, twelve by nine and three high. 
  FIG. 9, FIG. 9A.   Illustrations of Different Molds use for Different Kinds of Food.  
  Triangle for Dressing  Tongues,  etc.  -For the largest ones have the three sides of the triangle each twelve inches long; the thickness at the base is three inches and two inches at the top; they can be made either of  rice  or  hominy  in molds having the required dimensions ( Fig.  10), or else lower ones with the following proportions: length at the base, twelve inches by eight high; cut off an inch and a half from the top of the smallest and three inches from the largest; this will form a platform for placing the subjects on. They can also be made of  bread  spread over with green  butter  and then heavily strewn with very finely chopped  green parsley.  Let it be well understood that the socles called dish bottoms are not intended to be eaten. The socle has nothing whatever to do with the dish itself; it represents an accessory made for the purpose of raising the  meats,  etc., dressed over it, showing off advantageously the surrounding garnishing. 
   FIG. 10.   An illustration of a Triangular Pattern used for Dressing Tongues.  
  H&#226;telets (Skewers) for Hot Removes and Entr&#233;es.  -H&#226;telets are employed either as an ornament or else a garnishing; they are applied to removes and entr&#233;e dishes. H&#226;telets should only be used on ceremonious occasions, for a too prodigal use of them is apt to decrease their value. They are ornamented with unpeeled  truffles,   mushrooms,  or cock's combs, either plain or double h&#226;telets are also composed of Villeroi quenelles,  sweetbread  croquettes, or glazed  crawfish;  they are also made of vegetables,  carrots,   turnips  and  artichoke  bottoms slightly blanched. H&#226;telets in tended for garnishing cold pieces are to be found in the chapter on cold dishes (2526). 
  FIG. 11.  An illustration of a Hatler in a Flowery Pattern.  
  Fancy Frills for Large Pieces, such as  Leg of Mutton,   Ham,  etc.  -Cut a band of  paper  twelve inches long by three and a half wide; fold it in two on its length and again in two, this making a seven-eighths of an inch wide band, cut it finely on the folded edge, or else pass it through a cutting machine; unfold the band, turn it over so that the cutting detaches better, then twist this band in a spiral around a tin tube; fasten the end with a little mucilage, take it off the tube and place inside either a straight or turned up sconce. To make these sconces, fold a thin sheet of  paper  six inches square in two, then in four, then again fold in a triangle, beginning at the pointed ends, fold it once more. Cut the  paper  pointed shaped beginning from the center and rounding toward the bottom; unfold, and with the blade of a small knife, press down each fold so as to have them all come on one side and thus form a kind of pointed funnel.

  Fancy Frills for Cutlets,  Chicken Legs  or  Wings.   -Cut some sheets of  paper  five inches long by three inches wide, fold in two across the length; fold once more in two; cut them by clipping in slits one thirty-second of an inch apart, or else use the machine. Fold this band, twining it in such a manner that the slits are rounded, then fasten with a little mucilage; roll the frill spiralwise on a column-tube or a piece of round wood three-eighths of an inch in diameter. Attach the end of the  paper  with a little mucilage and when the frill is properly fastened, cut the ends off straight so that they are all of one length ( Fig.  12).   Favor Frills.  -Have a small piece of rounded wood an eighth of an inch in diameter and an inch and three-quarters long, tapered on one end; roll on this spiralwise, some prepared  paper  a third smaller than for the other frills; fasten the two ends together on the stick and trim the  paper  adhering to the stick with a small ribbon fastened on in the shape of a little rosette. These favors are for  chicken-breasts,   lobster  cutlets, etc.  
  
  (11). TO PREPARE BOUCH&#201;ES  (Pour Pr&#233;parer les Bouch&#233;es). 
  Roll out on a  flour ed table some six turned  puff paste   (No. 146) , keeping it one quarter of an inch in thickness; let this  paste  rest, and then cut from it a dozen round pieces, using a channeled pastry cutter, from two, to two and a quarter inches in diameter ( Fig.  16). Turn these over on to a wet baking sheet, leaving them a short distance apart, and  egg  over the surfaces with a brush. Trace on them quickly a ring using a smooth, well heated pastry cutter ( Fig.  17), so that the incision is clear, and with a small knife trace three lines in the inside of this ring ( Fig.  18); put the baking sheet into an oven, not excessively hot, and cook the bouch&#233;es for eighteen to twenty minutes; detach them from the baking sheet, slipping a knife underneath each one, open at once to empty them, save the covers, and keep warm until needed.

  (12). TO BRAIZE OR PO&#201;LER, SMOTHER OR SAUTER (Pour Braiser, Po&#234;ler, &#201;tuver ou Sauter). 
 Braizing   meat  is to cook a piece of  meat  in a saucepan, lining the bottom with bardes or slices of  fat pork,  slices of  veal,   carrots  and  onions  cut in slices, a bunch of  parsley  garnished with  bay leaves,  a little  thyme,   chives  and one  onion  with  cloves  in it. Arrange the  meat,   fowl  or  game  on top of these and moisten with some  broth,  then re-cover the  meat  with more bardes of  fat pork;  these  meats  must be cooked slowly in a slack oven, or by placing hot  coals  on the cover.   Po&#233;ler.  -Cut up one pound of  breast of pork  and half a pound of raw  ham,  into half inch squares; six ounces of  carrot,  four ounces of  onion  in half inch squares, two  bay leaves,  the same quantity of  thyme,  a bit of  mace,  two  cloves  and some  basil,  the whole of these aromatics tied inside a bunch of  parsley.  Melt the  pork  with the vegetables and bouquet, not letting it color, then place on top a  fat  pullet prepared and trussed as for an entr&#233;e, covering the  breasts  with slices of peeled  lemon,  and bardes of  fat pork  tied on with a string; pour over some  fat broth  from the  stock -pot and also some  white broth  to moisten to half the height, being careful to renew the moistening at times so that the same quantity always remains.   Smothering   meat  is to cook it slowly in a good  stock  without evaporation taking place, so that it cooks entirely and retains its natural flavor. Smothered  meats  must always be thoroughly cooked.    Sauter.  -Either in a sauteuse or in a pan; let the article cook rapidly on a quick fire tossing backward, forward, and frequently. We saut&#233;  potatoes , etc.  Chickens  or  tenderloin  are saut&#233;d either in  fat  or  oil  on a moderate, but well regulated fire, turning the  meats  over when they are a fine color.  
  
  (13). TO BREAD WITH BREAD CRUMBS, ENGLISH, FLOUR, MILANESE CRACKERS AND DEVILED  (Pour Paner &#224; la Panure, &#224; l'Anglaise, &#224; la Farine, &#224; la Milanaise, &#224; la Poudre de Cracker et &#224; la Diable). 
  Bread Crumbs.   -We generally  bread crumb  all substances that are to be broiled or fried; if for broiling, they must first be coated with  oil  or melted  butter,  then laid in  bread crumbs,  or  white  breading, or else in  bread  raspings, or brown crumbs as explained below.  For substances to be fried, such as croquettes, roll them first in  white bread crumbs,  then dip them in beaten  eggs  strained through a Chinese strainer, or else put four  eggs  in a bowl with  salt,   pepper,  a tablespoonful of  oil,  the same quantity of  water,  and strain all through a strainer.  Drain quickly and roll them again in  white bread crumbs,  and smooth the surfaces either by rolling them on a table or else use the blade of a knife.   To  Bread Crumb,  English Style.  -Use only the  yolk of the eggs  instead of whole ones, mixing for each ten  yolks,  ten ounces of melted  butter.     White Bread Crumb.   -Is used for breading  meats,   fish  and all substances to be fried; this breading is prepared with slightly  stale bread,  cutting off the crusts, and grating or rubbing the crumbs in a cloth, then passing it through a sieve ( Fig.  95), it must be kept in a cool, dry place, spreading it out and stirring at times.   Brown  Bread Crumbs.   -Is prepared with  white bread  dried in a heater and slightly browned in a very slack oven and afterward pounded and sifted through a sieve ( Fig.  95).   To  Bread  with  Flour.   -Dip the articles such as  fish,  etc., in seasoned  milk,  then roll them in  flour.  For  egg -plant, roll them merely in  flour,  omitting the  milk.    To  Bread Crumb  &#224; la Milanaise.  -Mix  bread crumbs  and grated  parmesan cheese,  half and half; dip the substances to be breaded, in melted  butter,  then lay them in the  cheese  and  bread-crumb  mixture, equalizing well the crumbs with the blade of a knife.   To  Bread  with Powdered  Crackers.   -Dip the substance in beaten  egg  and its equal quantity of  milk  and then roll them in powdered  crackers.    To  Bread  &#224; la Diable (deviled).  -Season first the substances, then coat them over with  mustard  and dip them in beaten  eggs  and roll them lastly in  bread-crumbs.   
  
  (14). BREASTS OF PORK SALTED AND SMOKED, ENGLISH BACON (Lard de Poitrine Sal&#233; et Fum&#233;. Petit sal&#233; &#224; l'Anglaise). 
If needed for summer use, begin toward the end of March to dry- salt  some  breasts of pork  for four days, then pack them tight in a salting tub and cover over with a thin layer of  salt.  Pour over them a freshly made, and highly  salted brine,  place on top a perforated cover, and lay over some heavy stones, so that the  breasts  are entirely submerged, and leave them in this state until needed, setting the tub in a cool well-aired place.  This  salt pork  will keep well until the fall, although it will be much saltier than if prepared in the usual way. The usual way is to wash the  breasts  and put them in  brine  in a special salting tub without any other  meat;  use a fork to remove them from the  brine,  as the hands cause fermentation, and when the  salt pork  is needed for use, it can be unsalted in  cold water  for several hours or till sufficiently done.  Bacon  or  smoked salt pork  is prepared the same, putting it in a  brine  half as strong and keeping it in a 50 degree Fahrenheit temperature, but no more. Drain and dry in an aired place, then smoke for three days in the cold.  
  
  (15). BRINE  (Saumure). 
 Brine  is used for the preservation of  meats  and at the same time to give them the taste of any preferred aroma; for this reason we select among the many ways that are employed in different countries, one that we are sure will answer for our present needs.  Boil in a large kettle twenty-five quarts of  water,  twenty-four pounds of  salt,  two pounds of  saltpetre,  three pounds of  brown sugar  and two ounces of  carbonate of soda.  Into a bag put a mixture weighing ten ounces, including  thyme,  bayleaf,  sage,   rosemary,   juniper berries,   savory,   having more of each as desired, or less, if a certain taste displeases. After the  salt  is dissolved, leave the liquid to cool and then weigh it with a  salt  weight; with this it should be twelve degrees.  To  salt  the  meats,  be careful to accomplish this when dry, by rubbing the  meat  with  salt  and a little  saltpetre  and then let rest for twenty-four hours before putting it in  brine.  Strain the  brine  and cover all the salted parts and leave it in a cool place during the operation. The time needed for salting is according to the size of the pieces.  A  ham  weighing seventeen pounds requires twenty-five days; a  breast  weighing twelve pounds requires fifteen days; a shoulder weighing fifteen pounds requires twenty days.  These indications are for  meats  to be eaten unsmoked. In case they should be smoked leave them ten days longer. Soak for twelve hours in  cold water  and then hang them in a smoking room or else in a big chimney, having them smoke slowly with  oak  shavings mixed with  thyme,  bayleaf,  sage,  etc.   To  Salt Hams.   -Put into a large kettle one pound of  salt,  four ounces of  saltpetre,  six ounces of  brown sugar,   thyme,  bayleaf,  basil,  two ounces of  juniper berries,  a quarter of an ounce of botanic calament, all tied up in a bag, and when the  salt  has dissolved by boiling, remove from the fire, let cool to settle the  brine  and then pour off the clear part. Burn some aromatic  herbs  in a barrel, put in the  hams,  pour the  brine,  already strained through a sieve, over, close the barrel and leave it for eighteen days; drain out the  hams,  hang them up for twelve days in a well-aired cool place, then hang them in the chimney for twenty days. Wrap them in sheets of  paper  and hang in a dry place.   For Winter  Hams.   -These  hams  can only be kept during the winter. Have two hundred pounds of small  corn-fed hams;  rub over well with  salt,  then put them into a barrel and leave them for three days in a very cool place. Three days later put them into another barrel, cover over with  salt brine,  having sufficient  salt  to allow a  potato to float  on the surface; the  hams  must be entirely immersed in the  brine,  cover with a board and a weight atop. Twelve days after change them into another barrel and pour the  brine  again over, this is so that they change positions and  salt  easier.  After another lapse of twelve days, drain and put them to soak in  cold water  for twelve hours; drain once more, leave to dry in the open air for eight days, then smoke them in a smoke house for two days with  hickory  wood.  
  
  (16). CLARIFIED AND PURIFIED BUTTER  (Beurre Clarifi&#233; et &#201;pur&#233;). 
 Clarified.  -To clarify  butter  it should first be melted so as to  extract  all the  buttermilk,  letting it cook slowly; skim and when well despumated from all its impurities and it begins to smoke then it is ready; strain it through a fine piece of linen and keep to use when needed.   Purified.  -Melt some  butter  in a deep saucepan, boil it for two or three minutes, remove, let stand to settle, then skim and pass it through a fine sieve pouring off the top only so to leave the sediment on the bottom.  
  
  (17). BUTTER FOR BUTTERING MOLDS  (Beurre Pour Beurrer les Moules). 
Melt one pound of  veal kidney suet  by chopping it up finely, then putting it into a saucepan with half a pint of  water  on a slow fire, stir occasionally to prevent its fastening on to the bottom of the saucepan and when the  fat  is limpid, add the same weight of fresh, saltless  butter;  stir until the  butter  and  fat  are perfectly clear.    Cold Butter  for Buttering Molds.  -It suffices only to knead some un salted butter  on the table to  extract  all its moisture and give it body, then put it into a cloth, sponge it off, put it in a pan in a warm temperature and work it until it becomes soft as  cream.   
  
  (18). TO PREPARE LIQUID CARAMEL  (Caramel Liquide). 
Liquid  caramel  is most necessary; it is used for coloring broths,  gravies  and even sauces, when their tints are found to be too light, still  caramel  should be used with discretion, for it is apt to give a bitter taste to the colored liquids into which it is added. Put a few spoonfuls of  powdered sugar  into a copper pan, stir it over a slow fire, then remove it on to a slower one to let cook until it becomes quite brown, and the smoke arising from it is whitish, this is a sign that it is thoroughly done. Take the pan from off the fire, moisten the  sugar  proportionately  with  hot water,  and allow the liquid to boil while stirring, and cook till the consistence of a light  syrup  is obtained.  Caramel  should be kept in a small, well-closed bottle, having a cork perforated lengthwise, so that when the bottle is turned over, the liquid can drop out slowly without it being necessary to uncork it.  
  
  (19). TO CARVE ON THE TABLE  (Pour D&#233;couper &#224; Table). 
Carving should be done with ease and dexterity. It is a simple operation, yet to be a perfect carver one must have a few ideas of the natural construction of the various pieces to be cut up. The  meat  to be carved must be laid on a dish without any  sauce  or garnishing, so as to be able to turn it around to the most convenient position. The tools indispensable for carving consist of a solid two or three-pronged fork, a good, keen, sharp-bladed knife and a pair of carving scissors. It is essential to begin on the most practical side, and also to be able to distinguish all of the best parts so as to carve without deteriorating from their appearance or without injuring their gastronomical qualities.

  FIG. 21, FIG. 22.   An illustration of Two Kitchen Utensils Similar to the Shape of Scissors.  
 It is an easy study, but one that ought not to be neglected, for what embarrasses and confuses a carver is when he is unable to find the different joints, or else when he begins cutting a piece of  meat  against the grain. It is to facilitate this operation that we deem it necessary to give a few hints and suggestions, and as almost each piece is accompanied by a design, it will be easy to learn how to carve those  meats  usually served whole on the table.  
  
  (20). FISH; HOW TO CARVE  (Pour D&#233;couper le Poisson). 
A general rule almost always observed for cutting up  fish  at table, is to use only silver implements; this to be specially followed for boiled and braised  fish.  Fried  fish  is the only kind where knives are allowable. To carve boiled  fish,  use either a silver  fish  slice, spoon or fork. The lines traced on the back of the  fish  ( Fig.  23) denote in what direction it must be cut, observing, as the figure indicates, that it should be on the opposite side to the belly, for on this part the fleshiest  meat  is found. To cut up a  bass,   salmon,  etc., or any  fish  of a long shape, first trace a line following the course of the  bone,  beginning at the  head  and finishing at the tail, then divide this back piece into slices and lay each one on a separate plate. All  meats  taken from the back and sides of a  fish  are fleshier and preferable to those found on the belly. 
   FIG. 23.  An illustration of a Large Fish with Different Dotted Lines on the Front Portion of the Body.  
    Fish  slice.  -A name given to a certain utensil with which  fish  is cut at the table to serve it on plates. These slices are made of silver or silver-plate; the blade is broad and sharpened on one side, fastened to a handle. Smaller slicers are also placed on the table to facilitate serving flat cakes, flawns and tarts that are difficult to lift with a spoon or a knife.

  (21). PARTRIDGES; HOW TO CARVE  (Pour D&#233;couper les Perdreaux). 
There are various ways of carving  partridges;  when young, simply divide them in two length-wise; when large, either detach the hind part from the  breast  or divide each one in three on their length, that is, cut a part of the  breast  with the  leg  on, so to leave the upper  breast  adhere to a part of the carcass; then detach with a pair of carving scissors; this is demonstrated in the drawing. If the hind part is detached with the  breast,  then this should be divided into three parts and returned to their original position; in this manner it is difficult to perceive that the  partridge  has been cut, for it is given its natural form. Large  partridges  need simply cutting in four.

  (22). PHEASANT AND GROUSE OR PRAIRIE CHICKEN; HOW TO CARVE  (Pour D&#233;couper un Faisan une Grouse ou un T&#233;tras). 
A  pheasant  can be carved the same way as a large  chicken  ( Fig.  35), which means to cut it in five pieces, but should it be extra large two fillets can be taken from each side of the  breast,  leaving an upper or central part of the  breast.  The  legs  are generally dry and tough, yet should they have to be served, cut each one in two.  Grouse or prairie  chicken  can be carved exactly the same.  
  
  (23). ROAST BEEF; HOW TO CARVE RIBS  (Pour D&#233;couper une Pi&#232;ce de C&#244;tes de B&#x153;uf R&#244;ti). 
  FIG. 29.  An illustration of a Large Portion of Roast Beef placed on a Large Tray along with a Carving Knife.  
American  roast beef  is taken from the  ribs;  sometimes seven  ribs  are served, but the piece containing only six is far more advantageous, while the four  rib  piece, cut from the short  loin  is  better still.  Roast beef  must be carved on the table, or else on the dining-room sideboard, for when cut beforehand it becomes dry and loses the best part of its  juices.   Roast beef  is to be cut in thin slices, leaving a small piece of  fat  adhering to each one; at once place them on hot plates and be careful to baste with a little of the  gravy  flowing from the  meat  on to the dish.  
  
  (24). TENDERLOIN OF BEEF; HOW TO CARVE  (Pour D&#233;couper un Filet de B&#x153;uf). 
Whether the  tenderloin  be roasted or braized, when cutting off slices for the guests, do not let them be too thick or too thin; remove half an inch of the  sole  from the  tenderloin  ( Fig.  30) and cut the  meat  into even thin slices, crosswise if the  tenderloin  be large; if thin, have the slices cut on the bias, but do not penetrate through the  sole  piece; pare the bottom free of  fat.  Serve these slices on very hot plates with a little of its  gravy,  independent of the accompanying  sauce  or garnishing, which must be served separately. 
  FIG. 30.  An illustrtion of a Tenderloin of Beef Ready to be Craved.  
 
  
  (25). HOT HAM; HOW TO CARVE  (Pour D&#233;couper un Jambon Chaud). 
 Ham  served hot is better when carved at the table, for it retains its essential  juices.  The most delicate part of a  ham  is the kernel, it being the fleshiest: this is to be cut in not too thick slices, leaving the  fat  adhering to the  meat,  then placed on hot plates; serve a good  sauce  separately in a sauceboat. When the  ham  is accompanied by a garnishing, it must also be served separately and offered to the guests. In order to have a  ham  prepared for handing round, it should first be cut up, then reconstructed the same as should a  leg of mutton.  
  FIG. 31.  An illustration of a Large piece of Ham ready to be Craved.  
 
  
  (26). LEG OF MUTTON; HOW TO CARVE  (Pour D&#233;couper un Gigot de Mouton). 
If the  leg  be roasted, carve it at the table or in the dining-room. It must be served on a dish without  gravy,   sauce  or garnishing. Seize the end  bone  of the  leg,  having the kernel uppermost, for this is to be cut first, it being the fleshiest and the best part of the  leg.  The slices must be broad and thin, to be served on very hot plates, each one accompanied by a little of the good  gravy  flowing from the  meat.  Should the  leg  have a garnishing this must be served apart. 
  FIG. 32.  An illustration of a Leg of Mutton with Carving Lines shown.  
  Lamb  is carved the same way. The  bone  end of the  leg  to be trimmed with a specially made handle, or else a fancy favor frill. When the  leg  is to be presented at the table, it should be previously carved and reconstructed to its original shape.  
 
  
  (27). SADDLE OF MUTTON, SADDLE OF LAMB, AND SADDLE OF VENISON, ROASTED; HOW TO CARVE  (Pour D&#233;couper une Selle de Mouton, d'Agneau, et de Chevreuil R&#244;ti). 
The dish containing these roasts must be placed on the table before the person who is to carve; the  loin  end to be turned to the left, for from this end is the saddle begun. There are two ways of carving the roasted saddle; the first way is to cut the slices on the length of the  meat,  slightly bias; see braized saddle,  Fig.  33. They to be neither too long nor too thin. For the second way, the slices are cut the entire length of the  meat,  but in every case serve on very hot plates, adding a little of the good  gravy  from the  meat  and serving another  gravy  separetly in a sauceboat.  
  
  (28). BRAIZED SADDLE OF MUTTON; HOW TO CARVE  (Pour D&#233;couper une Selle de Mouton Brais&#233;e). 
To have a braized  saddle of mutton  carved on the table, it should be placed on a hot dish without any  gravy  or garnishing; first make two incisions, one on each side, just between the  fat  of the flank or the kernel, then cut the large fillets across in rather thick slices; avoid having too much  fat  on any of them. A  saddle of mutton  can be carved in the kitchen without deteriorating from its good qualities; in this case, remove the fillets entirely, pare free of all  fat  and cut them across in half inch thick slices; return them to their original position, and when serving, hand around at the same time, both garnishing and a sauceboatful of  gravy  or  sauce.  
  FIG. 33.   An illustration of a Braised Saddle of Mutton with Craving lines shown on one part of the Meat.  
 
  
  (29). LOIN AND KERNEL OF VEAL; HOW TO CARVE  (Pour D&#233;couper une Longe ou une Noix de Veau). 
Before carving a  loin of veal,  first detach the  tenderloin  and  kidney;  cut the  loin  into cross-wise slices, not too thin, and place each one on a hot plate, adding a slice of the  kidney  or minion fillet, also a little good  gravy  or any  sauce  accompanying this remove, only serving it separately.  On  Fig.  327 will be found a larded kernel of  veal,  served as an entr&#233;e on a round dish. In order to cut the kernel, it requires to be held firmly by the fork on the  udder  side, enabling the larded  meat  to be cut in not too thick slices. Serve on hot plates with a little  gravy,  independent of the  sauce  or garnishing that accompanies it.  
  
  (30). GOOSE OR DUCK; HOW TO CARVE  (Pour D&#233;couper une Oie ou un Canard). 
 Geese  and  ducks  are carved the same as other poultry; when young, their  legs  can be served, but if large and older it were better to leave them undetached on the carcass. To carve a  goose  with ease, the  breast  must be turned toward the carver, as shown in  Fig.  34. The  meats  of each side of the  breast  are to be cut in not too thin fillets and immediately placed on hot plates, then basted over with a little good  gravy.  When the  geese  are stuffed, add to each plateful a small piece of the dressing. If serving the  legs  of a young  goose  or  duck  it is obligatory, first to detach them from the carcass and divide in medium-sized pieces with the carving scissors. Large tame  ducks  are carved the same as  geese,  and young ducklings can be separated in four parts. The  breast  alone of  wild ducks  is used, lifting one fillet from off each side or both fillets may be divided lengthwise in two; serve these on a little good  gravy  taken from the carcasses, after breaking them up and pressing out all the  juice;  heat this  gravy  slightly with  lemon juice,   salt,  mignonette and finely chopped blanched  shallot.  
  FIG. 34.   An illustration of a Goose with craving Lines drawn on it.  
 
  
  (31). PIGEONS; HOW TO CARVE  (Pour D&#233;couper des Pigeons). 
Young  pigeons  are served whole or simply cut lengthwise in two; when very large, separate the hind part from the  breast  part and make two pieces of each of these.  
  
  (32). A PULLET OR CAPON; HOW TO CARVE  (Pour D&#233;couper une Poularde ou un Chapon). 
A large piece of poultry that requires to be carved at table, calls for the greatest care in order to have all the pieces  neat,  even and of a proper size, neither too large nor too small. A pair of carving scissors will be found indispensable. To proceed with ease have the pieces laid on a dish  in front of the carver; should the pinions be left on the  wings,  cut them off with the scissors, then cut from the  breast  one small slice, taking the minion fillet along; from the remainder of the  breast  cut another pretty slice through the entire length. If the  breast  of the  chicken  be very large cut from it another slice without encroaching on the top part of the  breast;  after one side is finished cut the other without changing its position and as soon as the fillets are all removed, detach the  thighs  from the carcass by disjointing them, but first cut away the  skin  from the carcass just where the  thigh  begins; in this way it can be lifted off with a fork assisting with the blade of a knife. As soon as one  thigh  is detached, separate the  leg  at the knee  bone  with the scissors and divide the  thigh  in two, either across or on the length. 
  FIG. 35, FIG. 36, FIG. 37.  An illustraion of a Pullet from Different angles. Shown with Carving Lines.  
 The carcass can also be divided transversely in two or three pieces. The whole operation must be dexterous and speedy as all eyes are apt to be watching the carver, therefore he must not hesitate, but proceed bravely to the end. When a medium-sized  fowl  is to be carved, it can first be divided into four parts, detaching the  legs  from the carcass, then the  breasts  without making any upper  breast.  With these four parts eight pieces can be secured, two from each  leg  and two from each  breast,  cutting these on their length according to the lines marked in the figures.  
  
  (33). ROAST TURKEY; HOW TO CARVE  (Pour D&#233;couper une Dinde R&#244;tie). 
To be able to carve a  turkey  at table it requires a certain amount of self-possession, for they are frequently very  fat,  and, therefore, more difficult to manipulate than a pullet. Unless it cannot be avoided, the  legs of a roast turkey  should not be detached, serving only the  breast  part; this is done in two distinct ways: the first consists of cutting the  breast  pieces in crosswise slices slightly on the bias as shown in the figure; the second by cutting the fillets lengthwise from the  breasts  without having any upper  breast  part; in either case it is proper before beginning to detach the  wings  from both sides with a part of the  breast  adhering. When the  thighs  are wanted, detach them one after the other; clip off the  drum  sticks at the knee joint and then divide the second joint  meats  in pieces, leaving the  drum  stick whole. The  gravy  that is to be served with a  roast turkey  should always be in a separate sauceboat.

   For Chopped  Parsley   see No.  123    For  Truffles.   -Slice them and wipe off all the adhering moisture, then chop them up fine, spread them on a tin sheet covered with a sheet of  paper,  dry in the air and keep them in a cool place till needed.    For  Onions.   -Cut them in two, suppress the end stalk, and slice them perpendicularly, then cut them horizontally into squares more or less large; they may afterward be chopped up so as to loosen them, and have them finer; wash them in  cold water,  drain on a cloth to  extract  all the liquid; proceed the same for  shallots,  without cutting them in two and put them on a plate in a cool place.   For  Mushrooms.   -If they are already cooked, drain them well, slice, then chop them up; if raw, peel off the  skin,  wash them nicely, cut in squares, then chop; use them immediately.   For Red  Beef Tongue.   -Use only the thin end of the  tongue,  slice, chop and lay it on a tin sheet covered with a sheet of  paper,  expose them to a draught to dry, chop once more until very fine, then pass them through a sieve, and keep in a cool place till needed.   For  Lobster Coral.   -Take out the red part found inside of a boiled  lobster,  wash it nicely, changing the  water  frequently, dry it in the air, then chop it up very fine to pass through a sieve ( Fig.  96); spread it on a tin sheet over a sheet of  paper,  dry it in the air, and keep it for use in a cool place.  
  
  (35). TO COAT JELLY MOLDS AND MOLD JELLIES  (Pour Chemiser les Moules &#224; Gel&#233;e et Mouler les Gel&#233;es). 
If the mold need be only lightly coated, it is sufficient just to cool it on ice, then pour into it the cold liquid  jelly  and move it around so that it reaches all the sides; put the mold back on to the ice, and begin the operation again a quarter of an hour later, but should the coating of  jelly  be required thick, then  glue  over the top of the mold a heavy  paper,  and when the gum is dry, cut a ring in the surface of the  paper  with the tip of a small knife, leaving all around a margin a quarter of an inch, then pour some  jelly  into the mold, and turn it round on the ice inclining it in such a way that the coat acquires the necessary thickness on all its sides. 
  FIG. 39.  An illustration of a Round Jelly Mold filled wuth Nuts.  
  To Mold  Jellies.   -Put some ice into a small vessel, add its equal quantity of  water,  and set it in a cylindrical fancy mold: fill this up with some cold liquid  jelly,  lay on top and half an inch higher than the mold a tin sheet or plate, cover this with broken ice without any  salt  and after the  jelly  is thoroughly cold and firm, unmold it. In order to accomplish this, dip the mold quickly into  hot water  at one hundred and fifteen to one hundred and twenty degrees Fahrenheit; wipe it briskly and overturn it on to a cold dish as soon as the  jelly  detaches, and then remove the mold.  
  
  (36). TO PREPARE COCOANUT  (Pr&#233;paration de la Noix de Coco). 
Break a  cocoanut  across in two, exactly in the center; slip the blade of a thin round-tipped knife between the  nut  and the shell, push it in with the right hand and turn the  cocoa  with the left; detach and take out the entire half  nut;  remove the outer  skin  covering the  nut  with a vegetable knife ( Fig.  156), and when it is all peeled, throw the  nut  into  cold water;  drain and scrape it on a coarse grater. Use a part of it for roasting by putting the grated  nut  on a sheet of  paper  into a moderate oven and keep the remainder into a stone jar in the ice-box mixing it with an equal weight of  sugar.   
  
  (37). VEGETABLE COLORS  (Couleurs V&#233;g&#233;tales). 
 Spinach green  is frequently used for coloring pur&#233;es, soups, butters, sauces and  sugar.  It is the healthiest coloring matter, and if possible use no other.  Spinach green  is prepared with very green, fresh  spinach,  well washed, pounded in a mortar and when well reduced to a  paste,   extract  all the  juice  through a coarse cloth, and place this in an untinned copper  sugar  pan, and heat it till it decomposes, then pour it over a fine sieve so the  pulp  or coloring matter remains on top; the strained liquid is colorless and useless. For yellow, use a  decoction of saffron  or  dandelion  flowers; for red, employed for coloring bisques, orchanet dissolved in  butter  is used. The roucou annotto also gives a yellowish red and is much used. Vegetable colors, and clarified carmine,Breton Landrin, are those mostly employed. Breton Landrin green is beautiful for coloring  sugars  cooked to crack, as it is not detrimental to its transparency.    Colorings: Carmine and Cochineal Red.  -Take two ounces of No. 42 carmine, broken in pieces; wet with a little  cold water;  crush in a small mortar and dilute with a little twenty-five degree  syrup.  Besides this, boil two quarts of  syrup  also to twenty-five degrees, mix in the carmine, boil up once, strain through a napkin and leave to cool, then add a few coffeespoonfuls of liquid  ammonia  and pour into bottles.   For Red  Cochineal.   -Finely pound five ounces of fine  cochineal;  place it in a copper pan and moisten with a quart of  water,  adding three ounces of  cream of tartar,  three ounces of  alum  and six ounces of  sugar;  set the pan on the fire and let the liquid reduce to half; now put in two gills of  spirit of wine;  boil up once, strain through a napkin and pour into bottles.  
  
   (38). COURT-BOUILLON, PLAIN.   (Court-Bouillon, Simple). 
Plain court-bouillon is used for cooking large fishes, such as  salmon,   halibut,   bass  and  lobsters.   This court-bouillon is prepared with  vinegar,  roots and sliced  onions,  a large bunch of  parsley,   salt and water.  If the  fish  has to be plunged into  boiling water,  cook the court-bouillon for seven or eight minutes previous to putting it in, and if on the contrary, then pour the liquid over the  fish,  and bring it to a boil.  
  
  (39). COURT BOUILLON WITH WINE  (Court Bouillon au Vin). 
The court bouillon is a most necessary auxiliary in all kitchens, where it plays an important part; it is prepared fresh every day, and special care is taken to have it good, for in it the principal fishes are cooked, and with it the  sauce  Normande is made, so useful for hurried work.  First prepare a  broth  with the  heads  of large, fresh  fish,  some roots,  onions,  a bunch of  parsley  and a little  salt;  let it boil very slowly for half an hour, then strain and skim off the  fat,  and leave it to settle until clear. From the  bones  and  heads of bass,  sheepshead,  blackfish,  etc., the best  fish stock  is obtained.  Cook a mirepoix composed of sliced roots,  shallots  and  onions,  add to it the fragments of  fish  as explained above and cook these together for a few moments on a good fire; moisten with two or three gills of  white wine  and let it fall to a glaze over a brisk fire; moisten it again at once with two gills of  fish broth  and also let this fall to a glaze, then remoisten to their height with good  fish broth  and a little  white wine,  add a bunch of aromatic  herbs,  a bunch of  parsley,  and some fresh  mushroom  peelings, boil the liquid while skimming and set it on one side of the range to despumate for a quarter of an hour, skimming it carefully. Strain the  stock  through a sieve, let it settle, and pour off the top into a glazed vessel, and if it be not succulent enough, then reduce it again; keep it in a cool place.  This  stock  may be easily kept from one day to another, if care be taken to keep the vessel and its contents incrusted on ice. This court bouillon may also be moistened with  red wine;  in either case, it must be prepared with the greatest care possible.  
  
  (40). ALMOND CREAM  (Cr&#232;me d'Amandes). 
Pound one pound of  almonds  with one pound of  loaf sugar,  slowly adding four small  eggs  and some  orange flower water.  When the  almonds  have become a fine  paste,  take them from the mortar and transfer to a vessel, incorporating in six  eggs,  one at the time and one pound of fresh  butter  softened and divided in small pats.  
  
  (41). ENGLISH CREAM WITH COFFEE  (Cr&#232;me Anglaise au Caf&#233;).

Beat eight  egg-yolks  with half a pound of  sugar,  dilute with the boiling  coffee milk  strained through a fine colander; stand the saucepan on a slow fire, stir the  cream  until it becomes quite thick, without allowing it to boil, then take it off, strain through a sieve and pour it into a vessel, stir frequently till cold.  
  
  (42). ENGLISH CREAM WITH VANILLA, LEMON OR ORANGE ZEST (Cr&#232;me Anglaise &#224; la Vanille ou aux Zestes de Citron ou d'Orange). 
Beat in a saucepan half a pound of  sugar  with ten  raw egg-yolks;  mingle both well together and dilute with a quart of boiling  milk,  having had half a  vanilla  stick broken in pieces infused therein. Cook the  cream  on a moderate fire, stirring with a spoon, or whisk and thicken without boiling; strain this through a fine sieve into a vessel and let cool, stirring it occasionally until this occurs. This  cream  can be flavored with  lemon or orange peel  instead of  vanilla.   
  
  (43). FRANGIPANE CREAM WITH CHOCOLATE, OR WITH MARROW (Cr&#232;me Frangipane au Chocolat, ou &#224; la Moelle). 
  Chocolate.   -Add to some  vanilla  frangipane  cream  as described below, four ounces of  chocolate  melted in a slack oven and diluted a little at the time with  cream.     Marrow.   -Soak in fresh  water  four ounces of  marrow  cut in quarter inch pieces, then melt in a bain-marie. Into a saucepan put three ounces of  sugar,  six ounces of  flour,  four whole  eggs  and six  yolks;  stir well with a spoon and dilute with a quart of boiling  milk.  Pass this through a sieve into another saucepan, add an ounce of  butter  and cook, being careful that the  cream  contains no lumps; when well thickened remove from the fire; mix in a few spoonfuls of chopped  almonds  and the melted  marrow.   
  
  (44). FRANGIPANE CREAM WITH VANILLA OR ALMONDS (Frangipane Vanille ou Amandes). 
Place in a vessel six ounces of  flour,  six  egg-yolks,  two whole  eggs,  three ounces of  sugar  and a little  salt;  dilute with six gills of  milk.   Whip  well the preparation, pass it through a fine strainer into a saucepan and add to it three ounces of  butter  and half a  vanilla bean;  stir, placing the saucepan on the fire until the  cream  becomes consistent, then remove and beat it firmly off the range; put it back on the fire to cook for a few moments, suppress the  vanilla  if for almond frangipane, and mix in four ounces of pounded  almonds  and four ounces of  nut butter.   
  
  (45). MOCHA CREAM  (Cr&#232;me Moka). 
Put into a tinned basin sixteen  egg-yolks  and one pound of  sugar;  beat and dilute with a pint of very strong  coffee  and a pint of boiling  milk.  Set the basin on the fire, stir with a small  whip,  pressing it against the bottom, bring the liquid to a boil, without allowing it actually to boil, then remove from off the fire, let stand till cold. Put sixteen ounces of  butter  in a vessel, heat it lightly and work it well to a  cream,  then pour it into the preparation and stir the whole vigorously with a  whip.   
  
  (46). PASTRY CREAM WITH VANILLA  (Cr&#232;me P&#226;tissi&#232;re &#224; la Vanille). 
Place ten  egg-yolks  in a tinned basin, adding half a pound of  sugar  and an ounce of fecula or  corn starch;  mix the ingredients well together and dilute with a quart of boiling  milk,  having had half a  vanilla  stick infused therein. Stand it on the fire and stir continually until it thickens and is ready to boil, then pour into a vessel to use when needed.  
  
  (47). PISTACHIO CREAM OR NUT CREAM  (Cr&#232;me aux Pistaches ou aux Noisettes). 
Place eight  egg-yolks  in a bowl with one pound of  sugar,  beat well together and dilute with a pint of boiling  milk;  thicken this  cream  on the fire without allowing it to boil and as soon as it is cooked, take it off and add half a pound of pistachios pounded with  orange flower water,  vegetal green and kirsch, or else half a pound of roasted  filberts  pounded with a little  water  and maraschino. Incorporate some  cream  into either of these when nearly cold; also a pound of very good, fresh, un salted butter;  allow to cool.  
  
  (48). QUILLET CREAM  (Cr&#232;me &#224; la Quillet). 
Pour one pint of thirty-two degrees hot  syrup  into a small tin basin, adding sixteen  egg-yolks,  one  vanilla bean  and two gills of orgeat  syrup;  set the basin on the fire and stir continuously until the preparation almost comes to a boil, then take it off and when it has lost its greatest heat, incorporate in with a  whip  one pound of un salted butter  of the very finest quality procurable, dividing it into small pats.  
  
  (49). ST. HONOR&#201; CREAM  (Cr&#232;me St. Honor&#233;). 
Into a saucepan put ten  egg-yolks  and half a pound of  sugar,  one ounce of common  flour  and one ounce of  rice flour;  dilute with a pint of boiling  milk  into which half a  vanilla  stick has been infused. Put the saucepan on the fire and stir incessantly till the ingredients become consistent and are about to boil, then suppress the  vanilla.  Have twelve  egg-whites  already beaten to a stiff froth, incorporate them into the  cream,  beating it briskly with a spoon.  
 
  
  (50). WHIPPED CREAM OR CHANTILLY CREAM  (Cr&#232;me Fouett&#233;e ou Cr&#232;me &#224; la Chantilly). 
To obtain the very best result the  cream  must be the finest procurable and exceedingly thick. Pour it into a tinned basin, beat it with a tinned wire  whip  and if the  cream  be good it will rise in a few moments to a thick froth; should it be needed for meringue, after whipping it thoroughly add half a pound of  powdered sugar  for each quart of the unwhipped  cream.  For mousselines, after the  cream  is firmly whipped and not sweetened lay it on a hair sieve and leave it drain for one hour before using. After the  cream  is whipped it can be flavored by adding a tablespoonful of essence of  coffee  or one ounce of grated and sifted  chocolate  for every quart of  cream.  To flavor with  vanilla  add to the  sugar  one tablespoonful of  vanilla sugar.   
  
  (51). TO PREPARE CRO&#251;TONS FOR SOUPS, ROASTS, VEGETABLES, EGGS, ETC.   (Pour Pr&#233;parer les Cro&#251;tons Pour les Soupes, R&#244;tis, L&#233;gumes, &#x152;ufs, etc.). 
Cut the cro&#251;tons from the crumb of a stale loaf of  bread;  for entr&#233;es cut them half  heart -shaped, three inches long by two and a half wide, and a quarter of an inch thick (see  Fig.  40.); fry them in  butter,  and as soon as one side is browned, turn them over, and repeat until they have attained a fine color on both sides. 
  FIG.40.  An illustration of a Piece of Bread Cut in a Triangular Shape.  
  For Vegetables, Scrambled  Eggs,   Spinach,  Chiccory, etc.  -Cut them triangle shaped, one and a quarter inches on the sides, by one quarter of an inch thick; fry them in  butter,  browning them nicely on both sides.   For Soups.  -Serve cro&#251;tons three-sixteenths to four-sixteenths square or round shaped, three quarters of an inch in diameter, by one-eighth in thickness; either of these must be fried a fine color in  butter,  but do not allow them to get too dry. In order to obtain fine cro&#251;tons, they must be fried in  clarified butter,   lard  or  oil,  and in a sautoir, but not in the frying  fat.  
  FIG. 41.  An illustration of a Crust of an Oblong Shape.  
  For  Roast Game,   Pheasants,   Partridges,  Grouse and  Quail,   have oblong shaped cro&#251;tons; trim the edges and then cut off a quarter of an inch of the four corners; pass the knife all around the cro&#251;tons a quarter of an inch from the edge, fry and cut away the centers, scoop out the crumb from this space, and lay them under the  game;  reed-birds or  larks  must be laid on oblong cro&#251;tons sufficiently long to hold two or more birds, but do not scoop these out.   For Snipe,  Woodcock  or Plovers,  have wider, oblong crusts ( Fig.  41); dig out the crumb in the center to hold the bird and scoop out smaller hollows on each side, which should be garnished with a  forcemeat,  made of chopped up  chicken livers  and  shallots,  fried in scraped  lard;  mix some fine  herbs  with the  livers.  Epicures sometimes have the chopped intestines added to the  forcemeat.   
  
  (52). TO PREPARE HOLLOW CRUSTS  (Pour Pr&#233;parer les Cro&#251;tes Creuses). 
Hollowed out crusts are used for serving small garnishings composed of pur&#233;es,  game  fillets, and also boned small birds, such as  larks  and reed-birds; they are also employed to serve with poached  eggs,  after filling the hollow space with some garnishing. Hollow crusts are made of  bread crumb,  timbale  paste  or  puff paste.  
  FIG. 42, FIG. 43, FIG. 44, FIG. 44a.   An illustration of Different Molds to Make Hollow Crusts.  
   Bread Crumb  Crusts  are cut oval and half  heart  shaped ( Figs.  42 and 43); they are two inches long and three quarters of an inch thick; make incisions on one side near the edge, using for this a small knife; brown both sides in a sautoir with  clarified butter,  then drain them to open and scoop out the crumb.   Crusts made of Timbale  Paste   are formed from an oval layer of  paste,  three-sixteenths of an inch thick; they are shaped in unbuttered tin rings, half an inch high, either oval or round, plain or channelled ( Figs.  44 and 45); the  paste  is cut flush with the top of the ring, the ring is now removed and the outside edge of the  paste  is pinched prettily, the top also to form the crest; let   dry for a few minutes; they are now to be placed in larger buttered rings, or surrounded with bands of buttered  paper  to support the  paste  while cooking; line the inside with buttered  paper  and fill with raw  rice;  cook in a moderate oven; when done remove from the rings, empty out the  rice,  brush the crusts with an  egg -wash and put in the oven to color nicely. 
  FIG. 45.  An illustration of Different Molds used in Making a Hollow Crust.  
  To Make  puff paste  Crusts Plain or with Fluted Cutter.  -Cut the  paste  round or oval shaped in any desired size, arrange them on a moist baking sheet, a short distance apart, and prick them; moisten the edges with a brush and apply around this a band of the same  paste  three-sixteenths of an inch in thickness by five-sixteenths of an inch in width; fasten the ends of the band together,  egg  the surface and bake these crusts in a moderate oven the same as small bouch&#233;es.  
  
 (53). EGGING AND MOISTENING 
(Darer et Mouiller). Egging With Whole  Eggs.   -Beat the  eggs  with half as much  water  and run them through a sieve.    Egg-yolks  Alone.  -Stir the  yolks  with the same volume of  water  and strain.   With  Milk.   -Mix as much  milk  as  yolks,  beat well together and strain.   Moistening.  -Moisten lightly with  water,  baking sheets or else flats of  paste  on which another is to be laid in order to fasten the two together.  For both egging and moistening use a feather or very soft hair brush ( Fig.  184).  
  
  (54). TO BEAT UP THE WHITE OF EGGS  (Pour Fouetter les Blancs d'&#x152;ufs). 
Although the  eggs  intended for beating up the  white  should be perfectly fresh, still they must not be newly laid, for when these are used they are liable to become a greenish color, while baking. Procure an  egg -beater or a  whip  made for this purpose, and a small untinned basin, separate most carefully the  yolks  from the  whites,  and put these into the basin with a very little  salt,  then begin to  whip,  slowly at the beginning but proceed gradually to increase the velocity of the motion as the volume increases so as to allow them to absorb all the air possible, which gives them their consistency. Should the  whites  threaten to turn, they must be whipped again until smooth, adding to them a handful of  powdered sugar  or a few drops of  citric acid.  
  FIG. 46.  An illustration of a Tin Basin and an Egg Whisk.  
 
  
  (55). FAT PREPARED FOR FRYING  (Graisse Pr&#233;par&#233;e Pour la Friture). 
The preference is generally given to  beef kidney suet;  cut it in half inch pieces and place these in an untinned iron pan with one gill of  water  for every pound of  fat;  cook on a slow fire stirring carefully from time to time so that it cannot adhere to the bottom. When very clear and it ceases to froth it is a sign that it is done, then strain through a sieve or cloth.  
  
  (56). FAT FOR SOCLES AND FLOWERS  (Graisse Pour Socles et pour les Fleurs). 
  Fat  for Socles.  -Remove the  skin  and all the membranes from twenty pounds of  mutton kidney suet,  cut it up in half inch squares, and put this  grease  into twenty-five quarts of  cold water  with one pound of  carbonate of soda,  wash well the  fat,  change the  water  frequently, drain, then melt it on a slow fire, being careful to stir it so that it does not adhere to the bottom of the pan, nor brown in the slightest, add to it eight ounces of Siam benzoin and as soon as it is thoroughly rendered out, mix in the same quantity of  lard,  strain through a fine towel, and put it aside to cool slightly; then add a little ultra-marine blue. Stir with a whisk until cool, and having body enough to be worked: fasten a mandrel on a round or oval board, begin working at the bottom of the foundation with a profile, previously soaked in  cold water  and kept wet, and when the base is very firm, continue coating the mandrel with the  fat,  and profiling it until the whole socle is finished. Decorate with natural or  grease  flowers as below forming a wreath around the top of the mandrel, or if preferred festoon it, leaving a few inches of the decoration fall in  scallops  gracefully around.    To Make  Grease  Flowers.  -Have half as much  fat  prepared for socles as virgin wax, melting both together; color them in various colors while the  fat  is still hot and place in vessels keeping each color separate; have for instance:  white,  pink, red, green, brown, etc., let cool. Twelve hours later unmold the  fat  on to a wet napkin and scrape into fine shavings with a strong knife, then gather all of these in a damp cloth so as to soften and have it get smooth by kneading it till it becomes ductile as  clay;  roll into small balls and place these between two wet cloths; rub the top of each ball with a piece of smooth ice until it is very thin so that it resembles the petal of a real flower for example, to make a rose arrange some pink  fat  around a small stick to imitate the center of the flower, fasten on the petals all around as quickly as they are prepared and when there are sufficient, pull out the stick and begin another until enough flowers are obtained. Fasten them on to the upper border of a socle. This same  grease  can be used for modeling.  
  
  (57). TO SCALE AND CLEAN FISH; TO SKIN EELS  (Pour &#201;cailler le Poisson, le Nettoyer et D&#233;pouiller les Anguilles). 
 For English  Soles.   -Remove the black  skin,  starting at the tail with a knife, then pulling it off. If  trout  be required for boiling, they must be cooked with the scales on. German  carp  should not be scaled.   For  Salmon,  Turbot,  Bass  or Mullets.  -Scrape the outside with a strong knife in order to remove the scales. All  fish  must be emptied either by the gills or by an opening made in the belly; cut away the fins with a pair of strong scissors.   To  Skin Eels.   -They must be hung up by the  head  on a hook, remove a little piece of the  skin  all around below the fins so as to be able to catch hold of it, then grasp it with a cloth, and pull it down the whole length of the body, turning it inside out. Shave the spinal  bone  with a sharp knife, and in a contrary direction from the  bone,  or else the entire  bone  may be removed by detaching it from the flesh, beginning at the extreme thin end of the tail, and pulling it out entirely, the same for the ventral.  
  
  (58). FONDANT  (Fondant). 
Put into a small untinned copper basin two pounds of  loaf sugar,  moisten it with sufficient  water  to melt it, about one pint, and put the basin on a good fire to bring the  sugar  to a boil; skim it carefully and so long as the impurities rise to the surface and continue boiling till the  sugar  is cooked to the degree of ball; then pour it on to a marble table or slab and keep it in position by four bars of iron, an inch square, and the length needed; when it is thoroughly cold work it with a spatula until it becomes a  white  and creamy  paste;  set it in an earthen vessel, and keep it in a cool place to use when needed. This fondant can be flavored and colored according to taste.  
  
  (59). FORCEMEATS; REMARKS ON  (Observations sur les Farces). 
Forcemeats are indispensable for performing fine work and are liked by good  livers;  they are principally used for hors-d'&#x153;uvre, garnishings, removes and entr&#233;es; for  stuffing breasts  or shoulders of  veal,  poultry,  game  and  fish.  They are also necessary to form borders, for holding the garnishing and for large timbales; they must always be prepared in advance with the very freshest  meats,  otherwise they are likely to be of little good and liable to spoil, this being of the greatest importance to observe, and be sure to keep them on ice until needed. Always be careful when composing a menu, not to have too many dishes containing forcemeats, for they will detract from the simplicity and natural plainness of a dinner.

  FIG. 47.  An illustration of a Machine to Remove Nerves.  
  FIG. 48.  An illustration of a Round Shaped Metal Sieve.  
   Chicken.   -Use only the lean and well pared  meats  of poultry or  game,  some panada, fresh  butter,  or cooked and  cold veal udder,   raw egg-yolks  or else the  whites,  or sometimes whole  eggs,    salt  and  spices,  also cold sauces or else raw  cream.  Pass the  meat  once or twice through a machine to remove the nerves ( Fig.  47); afterward pound it to a  pulp  so it can readily pass through a metal sieve fitting on to the mortar ( Fig.  48); pound the  meat  once more, then add the panada, the  butter  or  udder,  continuing to pound all the time, and then add the  eggs  singly without ceasing to pound and the seasonings; pass through a strong hair sieve. Put this into a thin tin vessel, set it on ice and stir for a few moments with a spoon in order to have it perfectly smooth, keep in a cool place until needed.    Game.   -To make  game  quenelle  forcemeat,  proceed the same as for the  chicken;  to have it delicate, use  brown sauce  or melted  meat  glaze, and pass the  meat  once more after all the ingredients are mixed in. For this it requires a strong hair sieve, or one of fine tinned wire; stand this sieve on a round dish, slightly larger than itself, so it can receive the  forcemeat  as it falls through; put only a small quantity on the sieve at the time; press it forcibly with a large wooden spoon to have it pass through rapidly, and when all is finished, place it in a tin vessel and stir it for a few moments with a spoon to render it smooth and keep it in a cool place until needed.   To Rectify Forcemeats.  -Try a little piece, formed into a half inch ball, in  boiling water  or in the oven, and if too consistent add some  cream  or velont&#233;, for  white  forcemeats, and espagnole or melted glaze for brown  game.  If too weak, a little pounded panada is to be added, mixing it in gradually with some  egg-yolks, whites  or whole  eggs.

Make triangular shaped ravioles with this.  
  
  (94). TO PREPARE GELATINE FROM CALF'S FEET  (Pour Pr&#233;parer la Colle de Pieds de Veau). 
 Calf 's  feet gelatine  is more especially used for preparing  jelly  and gelatineous sweet dishes. Soak seven or eight very fresh calve's  feet,  split in two, having the  bones  all extracted, put them into a small soup-pot with  water  and let the liquid boil for ten minutes; then drain it off, also the  feet;  cool these off and return them to the clean soup-pot with two spoonfuls of  sugar,  the juice of four  lemons,  and half a bottleful of  white wine.  Cover with  water,  then heat the liquid while skimming, and at the first boil set it on the stove to obtain a regular and continuous ebullition for four to five hours, strain the liquid into a bowl and let it get very cold. When the  gelatine  is firm, remove all the  fat  from the top, then wash the surface with  warm water  so that not a vestige of  grease  remains. Lift out the  jelly  without disturbing the sediment at the bottom of the bowl, and put it back, either all or part into a saucepan to melt.  For one quart of  gelatine,  mix in three quarters of a pound of broken  sugar  and the juice of four  lemons;  when the  sugar  is dissolved, test the consistency so as to rectify it if necessary, by adding either more  water  or more  gelatine,  according to its strength or weakness. Beat four  egg-whites  without getting them frothy, put these into one gill of  cold water  and pour it over the dissolved  gelatine,  place the saucepan on a moderate fire, beat the liquid slowly till it is about reaching boiling point, then remove the saucepan to a slower fire, so that the liquid quivers, but does not boil; now add the juice of four  lemons,  cover the saucepan and keep it near the boiling point for thirty minutes, the  gelatine  should now be limpid. Filter it through a bag or strain it through a napkin fastened to the four  feet  of a filtering stool ( Fig.  51) and pour it back into the filter until it becomes perfectly clear; this operation must be performed in a very warm place.  
 
  
  (95). TO PREPARE PIG'S SKIN GELATINE  (Pour Pr&#233;parer la Colle de Couenne). 
Soak in  cold water  for five or six hours, six pounds of fresh  pork skin;  put it into a saucepan with  cold water  to double its height, and blanch it in this  water  until it boils, then drain and refresh it; scrape off the pieces one by one, wash them well, and return them to the saucepan with more clean,  cold water  and boil the liquid while skimming it; set it on one side of the range or on the gas stove, and add half a bottleful of  white wine,  then continue boiling for seven hours, skimming it frequently. Pass the liquid through a sieve into a basin, let it get cold and firm on ice, then remove all the  fat  from the top and wash the surface off with very  hot water;  melt it once more to mix in it with the necessary  broth  and clarify it with  meat  and  eggs  or  white of eggs,  proceeding the same as for aspic-jelly  (No. 103) .  
  
  (96). GHERKINS  (Cornichons). 
Cut off the stalks and ends from small  gherkin cucumbers;  put a few handfuls in a coarse towel or bag, with a heavy handful of kitchen  salt,  shake them in this bag to cleanse well and remove all the outer roughness and then toss them on a large sieve to free them of the  salt;  range in a barrel, pour over a  brine  made with sufficient  salt  to  float  an  egg  or a  potato  on its surface, cover, and on top lay a heavy weight to keep them under  water;  leave them so for six days. Now drain off the  brine  and return to the barrel more fresh  brine,  it containing as much  salt  as the first one; put back both cover and weight to keep them submerged under the liquid and leave stand in a cool place. After a short time a scum will form on the surface; this must in no ways be disturbed until the  gherkins  are needed, for it acts as a protector, preventing any air from penetrating into the liquid. When the  gherkins  are wanted for use, take them from the  brine;  unsalt by putting them in fresh  water  for twelve hours. Pour half  water  and half  vinegar  in an untinned copper basin, throw into it a small bagful of  spices,  such as  cloves,   peppers,   mustard seeds  and  mace.  Place on the fire and at the first boil, plunge in the well drained  gherkins  and leave to bubble for a few moments, then remove the basin from the fire and put both  gherkins  and  vinegar  into a large jar or barrel to cool off; put in with them a handful of  tarragon,  some small blanched  onions  and  shallots  and a few  red peppers;  stand this in a well aired place for a few days and the  gherkins  will be then ready for use.  
  
  (97). GRATED PARMESAN AND SWISS CHEESE  (Fromage de Parmesan et Gruy&#232;re r&#226;p&#233;). 
Cut off all the  rind  from the  cheese,  leaving no black part on whatever; grate by rubbing the  cheese  against a sufficiently coarse grater ( Fig.  177) until it is all consumed; keep in a cool but not too damp place.  
  
  (98). GRATED HORSERADISH AND HORSERADISH RIBBONS (Raifort R&#226;p&#233; et en Rubans). 
Grated  horseradish  should be made of clean, fresh  horseradish root,  peeled or scraped, washed and dried, then rubbed against a large grater; it can either be served fresh or put into a stone jar with  salt  and  vinegar,  corking it well to  preserve  till needed. For  horseradish  ribbons, peel the root the same as for grating, and scrape it with the sharp blade of a knife, held at an angle from the top to the bottom; by this method fine ribbons of the root are obtained; let them be as long as it is possible to have them. Long  horseradish  should be used for this purpose.  
  
  (99). COOKED CHOCOLATE ICING  (Glace Cuite au Chocolat). 
Put into a  sugar -pan a quarter of a pound of unsweetened  chocolate;  let it soften at the oven door, and dilute it with two gills of warm  syrup  at sixteen degrees, or simply with  water,  then add to the liquid some icing  sugar,  so as to obtain a smooth preparation neither too soft nor too thin.  
  
  (100). COOKED COCOA ICING  (Glace Cuite au Cacao). 
Dissolve a quarter of a pound of  cocoa  or unsweetened  chocolate,  in a  sugar -pan; cook three quarters of a pound of  sugar  in another pan with one pint of  water  till it reaches the degree of small thread, mash the  cocoa  with a spoon, dilute it gradually with the cooked  sugar,  then cook all together until it reaches small thread again; remove it from the fire, rub it against the sides of the pan with a spoon in order to mass it well; this icing is used to ice G&#233;noese, &#233;clairs and a variety of small cakes.  
 
  
  (101). ROYAL ICING, AND ROYAL ICING FLAVORED WITH ZESTS  (Glace Royale et Glace Royale Parfum&#233;e aux Zestes.) 
 Royal Icing.  -Put into a vessel the  whites  of one or several  eggs  (those not too fresh are preferable), and add to them some icing  sugar,  sifted through a very fine sieve, sufficient to have the  eggs  and  sugar  combined; form into a running  paste,  add several drops, either of  lemon juice  or acetic acid, according to the quantity of icing. With a wooden spatula beat up slowly to begin, then continue the action more briskly, always turning it in such a way that the air may enter, which helps to make the icing lighter and firmer. Beat it until the spoon, being lifted from the icing, it stands on it upright, without falling off. This royal icing is excellent for decorating pieces, cakes, etc., but for flowers or decorations to be made entirely of royal icing, then after beating, add more icing  sugar,  but do not get it too  hard.  Royal icing can be made any color by using vegetable colors.   Royal Icing flavored with Zests.  -Put into a basin, half a pound of  sugar,  add a few spoonfuls of  sugar  flavored either with  orange  or  lemon  zest, adding gradually sufficient  white of egg  to allow it to flow; this icing is used for covering cakes.  
  
  (102). ICING WITH SYRUP FOR CAKES FLAVORED WITH VANILLA, ORANGE, LEMON OR FRUIT JUICES  (Glace au Sirop pour G&#226;teaux Perfum&#233;e soit &#224; la Vanille, &#224; l'Orange, au Citron ou au Jus de Fruits). 
Put one pint of  water  and a pound of  sugar  in a saucepan, adding half a  vanilla bean  or else some  orange  or  lemon peel;  stand it on the fire, let boil up a few times to obtain a  syrup,  then remove the saucepan from the range immediately, suppress the  vanilla  or peels and incorporate sufficient  sugar  to form a very smooth flowing  paste.    For Uncooked  Fruit Juice  Icing.  -Prepare it with  strawberry,   raspberry,   currant  or  pineapple juice.  Simply crush the ripe, fresh  fruits,  pour them on a sieve to collect all the liquid. Put some icing  sugar  in a vessel, dissolve it with a little thirty-degree  syrup,  and the  fruit juice,  incorporating the liquid slowly; just before using this icing warm it in an untinned copper vessel, stirring it during the operation. The icing  sugars  are colored according to taste and are used for icing Genoeses, pouring it over or else dipping in all kinds of small cakes, such as &#233;clairs, etc.  
  
  (103). TO PREPARE, CLARIFY AND FILTER ASPIC JELLY (Pour Pr&#233;parer la Gel&#233;e d'Aspic, la Clarifier et la Filtrer). 
Aspic or  meat jelly  is prepared with  chicken  or  game broth,  obtaining it as clear as possible, and mixing it with a certain quantity of  gelatine  made either with  calf 's  feet  or  pig skin,  or even with  isinglass.  Aspics are also prepared with special stocks made under the following conditions: brown in a saucepan half a pound of  breast of veal,  one knuckle, and two  fowls,  suppressing the  breasts;  when the  meats  are lightly colored moisten them amply with some light  broth,  free of all  fat,  and add to it four or five boned and blanched  calf 's  feet,  also some roots and  onions,  a garnished bouquet, but no  salt,  boil the liquid while skimming, remove it to the side of the range, and finish cooking the  meats,  lifting them out as soon as they are done. Strain the liquid through a sieve, skim off all the  fat,  try a little of it on ice to judge of its consistency, and should it not be sufficiently firm, then heat it up once more, and stir into it a few  gelatine  leaves softened in  cold water  and dissolved in a small separate saucepan. The aspic should never be reduced with the idea of rendering it firmer, because the boiling only wastes it without thickening it; chop one pound of  lean beef,  one pound for two quarts of liquid, add to it four  egg-whites  or two whole  eggs  and one pint of  white wine,  dilute it gradually with the aspic  jelly,  put it into a saucepan on the fire, stir the liquid with a whisk until the instant boiling point is reached, then remove it to one side, and let it simmer very slowly, till it becomes perfectly clear, then strain it through a flannel bag ( Fig.  50); or moisten a clean napkin and arrange it on a kitchen filtering stool as shown in  Fig.  51; should the  jelly  not be sufficiently limpid, pour it through again until perfectly clear. 
  FIG. 50, FIG. 51.   An illustration of a flannel bag being upheld by a ring to left of text, Fig. 50, and a napkin on a kitchen filtering stool, Fig. 51.  
 
 
  
  (104). CALF'S FOOT JELLY WITH MADEIRA WINE  (Gel&#233;e de Pieds de Veau au vin de Mad&#232;re). 
Take the value of one quart of  calf 's  foot gelatine  and mix into it three quarters of a pound of  sugar  and the juice of four  lemons.  After the  sugar  is dissolved try its consistency to rectify it if necessary, adding more  water  or more  gelatine  according to whether it be too soft or too  hard.  Beat up four  egg-whites  without letting them come to a froth, mix in a gill of  cold water  and pour this over the dissolved  gelatine;  set the untinned basin on a moderate fire,  whip  the liquid slowly until on the verge of boiling, then withdraw it to a slower heat and keep the liquid simmering without boiling; now add the juice of four  lemons;  cover and leave stand for thirty minutes. The  jelly  should now be limpid; filter it through a flannel bag or a napkin fastened to the four  feet  of a filtering stool ( Fig.  51), return the  jelly  to the bag and continue the operation until it passes through clearly; this should be done in a warm place. As soon as the  jelly  is properly filtered let it stand until cold and then add one gill of good  Madeira,  pour it into a mold previously imbedded in ice and leave it for one hour and a half to set.  
  
  (105). MEAT JELLY WITH GELATINE  (Gel&#233;e de Viande &#224; la G&#233;latine). 
Put four quarts of good  broth  with one pound of  gelatine  into a saucepan, adding a quarter of an ounce of  pepper-corns , two  cloves,  a few branches of  celery  and a little  mace,  put it on to the fire and stir continuously with a  whip  until the liquid boils; season to taste. Break six  eggs,  put them with their shells into a bowl and beat them up a little mixing in with them, half a bottle of  white wine  or a quarter of a bottle of  Madeira,  one gill of  tarragon vinegar,  and a quart of small pieces of clean ice, dilute this with a quart of the liquid  jelly,  and pour the clarification into the remainder of the  jelly,  stirring it constantly, then return the saucepan to the fire and continue the beating. When the  jelly  has reached the boiling degree, remove it from the fire, and keep it very warm for half an hour, but it must not boil again; filter as indicated  (No. 103) .  
  
  (106). SWEET JELLY WITH GELATINE, OR FISH ISINGLASS (Gel&#233; Douce &#224; la G&#233;latine ou &#224; la Colle de Poisson). 
Put into a basin four quarts of  water,  three pounds of  sugar,  half a pound of  gelatine  or ten ounces of  fish isinglass  and the  peel of eight lemons,  stir the whole well together until the  sugar  is melted, then set the basin on a slow fire and beat well with a  whip;  as soon as it begins to boil put in twelve partly beaten  egg-whites  into which has been added the juice of twelve  lemons;  mix the whole well together stirring unceasingly and allowing it to boil slowly from fifteen to twenty minutes, then withdraw the basin from the fire and let the  jelly  rest for a few moments; now pour it through a flannel bag upheld by a ring ( Fig.  50); return it several times until it acquires a perfect limpidity. The  lemon-peel  can be suppressed, flavoring it with any kind of liquor or clarified  fruit juice.   
  
  (107). LARD  (Saindoux). 
  Lard   is the produce of leaf  lard  melted with  fat pork;  this operation should be performed rapidly, especially in summer time. Remove the membranes and sanguineous parts from all that is required for making the  lard  -say about twenty pounds; cut the leaf  lard  and  fat pork  into half inch squares and steep them separately for two hours in an abundance of  cold water  using twelve quarts for each and two ounces of crystal  soda  also for each; wash both in several waters, keeping them separated; drain and lay first the  fat pork  in a saucepan with four quarts of  water,  melt it on a slow fire being careful to stir the bottom frequently; as it melts it becomes  white  and milky, then transparent, when in this state, strain it through a colander and return it to a clean saucepan adding the leaf  lard;  set it on a good fire and stir incessantly until the squares become dry and brown, then strain the  fat,  press well the squares, leave to cool slightly, afterward adding a gill of  water  for every two pounds of the  fat.  Beat the whole vigorously, let cool and draw off the clear part before the  fat  has had time to congeal, just when it begins to set, beat thoroughly to have it smooth.  
  
  (108). OXONGE-LARD  (Oxonge-Saindoux). 
 Oxonge  is exclusively obtained by melting leaf  lard  without using any other material; oxonge is finer than  lard  and is also employed for kitchen and pastry purposes. The leaf  lard  is melted in a bain-marie or by steam, this latter method being preferable. Remove the  skin  and fibers from ten pounds of leaf  lard,  cut it up in squares about half an inch each and bathe them in eighteen quarts of  water  with half a pound of crystal  soda;  wash in several waters, drain and  pound in a mortar, then put it into a well tinned copper basin in a bain-marie and steam by keeping the  water  boiling all the time until the  lard  is all melted, now strain it through a fine colander and leave to cool slightly, adding one pint of  cold water,  stir well, let it rest, then pour off the clear part when it begins to set, beat well to have it smooth.  
  
  (109). VEAL UDDER.  (T&#233;tine de Veau). 
  Veal Udder   is the fatty part covering a kernel of  veal;  remove it entirely, tie it up and cook in plenty of  white broth;  when done take it out, pull off the string and press it lightly under a weight. Pare and cut it either into strips, squares or bands, etc. It is used in forcemeats instead of  butter,  pass it twice through the machine, pound well and then pass through a sieve. The way to keep it is to leave it covered in a cool place or else cover over entirely with  salt.   
  
  (110). TO PREPARE LARDING PORK  (Pour Pr&#233;parer le Lard &#224; Piquer). 
Lift the bands of  pork  leaving as little  meat  on as possible, from the first  rib  to the end of the  loin;  lay them in  brine  for three months, then drain off, and put them on a table to rub one by one and cover with  salt.  Set them one on top of the other in a cool, dry place and range a board over with a weight on top; turn them over, and throw on some  salt,  and at the end of a month change those from the bottom to the top, and three months after, fasten a strong twine to each piece, and hang them up separately in a cold, dark room to dry.   Another Way.  -The piece of  pork  taken from the back is the only one to use for larding purposes, as it is firm and not liable to crack. Remove all the  meat  from it, and cut it into an oblong piece, this being called a band;  salt  it dry with  fine salt  for three or four weeks, and if it be necessary to use it shortly after its salting, then rub it with very  fine salt,  and hang it up in a dry and cool place. This  pork  must be salted toward the end of the winter;  fat pork  never receives more  salt  than it needs, whichever way it may be employed, or however long the operation may last.  
  
  (111). TO CUT FAT PORK FOR LARDING  (Mani&#232;re de Tailler le Lard Pour Piquer). 
The larding  pork  must be  white  and firm, perfectly dry and cooled on ice, specially in summer so to make it harder and to be enabled to cut it more evenly. Divide the  pork  into the required length leaving on the  rind;  remove a slice from the top of the necessary thickness to have the  pork  of the same thickness throughout, paring the two ends square, then divide it into lardons at equal distances cutting them perpendicularly as far down as the  rind,  for this use a thin knife, called a  lard  slicer, and cut the  lard  the size designated by  Fig.  52, then cut them horizontally to obtain very square lardons of the desired size. 
  FIG. 52. FIG. 53. - Larding Needle for Beef &#226; la Mode. FIG. 54. - Trussing Needle. FIG. 55. - Large Larding Needle.   An illustration of Different Kinds of Needles used for Larding Purposes.  
 No. 1, lardons as represented in the figure are from three to four-eighths of an inch square, by three and one-quarter to four inches long. This size is for larding  beef  &#224; la mode, braised  tongue,  kernel of  veal,   leg of mutton,  etc.  No. 2, are three-sixteenths of an inch square by two and one quarter inches long; this size is convenient for saddles of  venison,  fricandeaux,  tenderloins of beef,  etc.  No. 3, these are five-thirty-seconds of an inch square, by two inches in length; this size is for poultry, large  game,   fish,   sweetbreads,   veal  cutlets, etc.  No. 4, lardons of one-eighth of an inch square, by one and three-quarter inches long; this size is for small  game,   pigeons,   chickens,  etc.  The lardons as shown in the figures are represented one quarter their actual size.  
  
  (112). TO LARD MEAT, POULTRY AND GAME  (Pour Piquer les Viandes la Volaille et le Gibier). 
If it be butcher's  meat,  pare it properly by removing in strips the  skin  covering the  meat,  then all the superfluous  fat.    The way to  lard  a  tenderloin,  is to pare a fine  tenderloin of beef,  weighing six pounds after it is trimmed; remove the  fat,  slide the blade of a thin knife between the  skin  and the  meat,  and press it on the  skin  so as to avoid injuring the flesh; remove also the superfluous  fat  on the side, then cut the two ends round shaped. Choose a larding needle of suitable size to hold the larding  pork  that should be cut into pieces of three-sixteenths by two and a quarter inches long; lay the  tenderloin  lengthwise on a heavy towel, place this over the left arm, then proceed to  lard  the  meat  with the larding needle threaded with a piece of the  pork,  boring the  meat  from right to left. The needle containing the  pork  must be stuck in the flesh to a depth depending upon its length, but the needle must be withdrawn with one stroke, so that the  pork  remains in the  meat  visible of an equal length on both sides. After the first row is larded, the next one should be slipped exactly between those of the first row; then instead of larding between the two lards of the last row, begin the operation from the start, which means  lard  two more rows the same as the first, observing that the second ones are arranged contrarywise to the first two, then continue until the whole  tenderloin  is filled. Proceed exactly the same for fricandeau, racks of  veal,  grenadins or  sweetbreads.  
  FIG. 56, FIG. 57, FIG. 58, FIG. 59.  An illustration of the Larding Process of Different Kinds of Meats.  
 When a piece of poultry or  game  is required to be larded, it must first be drawn, singed and trussed, then singe the  breast  once more, or else dip this part into  boiling water  to harden the  meat;  after this is cold,  lard  with lardons adapted to their size. This in fact is the whole theory of larding, and by examining various larded pieces, one can easily become an adept in the art.  
  
  (113). LEMONS; TO CUT THEM IN VARIOUS MANNERS  (Citrons Taill&#233;s de Diff&#233;rentes Mani&#232;res). 
First wash and wipe the  lemons,  then cut them lengthwise in four, to serve either with  oysters  or fried  fish.   Channeled slices of  lemon  are made by cutting small notches on the  lemon  lengthways of the peel, then cutting the  lemon  in crosswise slices an eighth of an inch thick. These are used for garnishing broiled  fish.  Slices of  lemon  cut the same way without being channeled, are frequently served with  tea.  
  FIG. 60, FIG. 61.  An illustration of Two Lemons Cut in Fancy Shapes.  
 Halved  lemons  are prepared by paring off the two ends and then make sixteen notches in the center, the third of the length of the  lemon  with the tip of a small knife; these gashes should be very regular; run the knife through as far as the center, having eight cuts to the right and eight to the left, this makes eight long triangles;  detach the  lemon  in two parts ( Fig.  60). These are used also for cold  fish  and h&#226;telets or skewers ( Fig.  61).  Shells of  lemon  can also be made, making two shells from one  lemon.  Cut from the center of the  lemon,  beginning at the stalk, as far as the middle of one side and from the other end of the  lemon  as far as the middle of the other side, about one half inch of the peel, without detaching it; cut across the  lemon,  keeping the ribbon of the peel intact, thus producing two identical pieces; these halved shells are used for garnishing fried fishes such as  sole  &#224; la Colbert, etc.  
  
  (114). COOKED MARINADE  (Marinade Cuite). 
Mince one pound of  carrots,  as many  onions  and half a pound of  celery root;  fry all these vegetables in a quarter of a pound of  lard  without letting them attain color, and moisten with two quarts of  vinegar  and one quart of  water  or more according to the strength of the  vinegar.  Add an ounce of  parsley leaves,  three bayleaves and as much  thyme,  half an ounce of  basil,   garlic,   cloves,  a bit of  mace,  a tablespoonful of crushed whole  peppers  and the same quantity of  allspice,  and some  salt.  Boil the whole for half an hour, put it aside to get cold and use this marinade for marinating  venison,   mutton,   hare,  etc.  
  
  (115). RAW MARINADE  (Marinade Crue). 
There are two kinds of raw marinade;  the first  one is made of  oil,  minced  onions,  branches of  parsley,   thyme,  bayleaf, slices of  lemon,   salt,  mignonette,  garlic  and  basil.   The second  one is made of two quarts of  vinegar,  four quarts of  water,  minced  carrots  and  onions,  bayleaf, a  clove of garlic,   thyme,   basil,   mace,  whole  peppers  and sprigs of  parsley.   
  
  (116). HOW TO DRESS MERINGUES  (Pour Dresser les Meringues). 
Prepare a meringue  paste  as in  No. 140.  Pour the preparation into a pocket furnished with a socket and push it into rounds on to  white paper  bands; dust them over with fine  sugar  and press down the middle lightly, so as to efface the tip, formed by the socket, then range these  paper  bands on top of some wet boards. Cook the meringues on these boards in a very slack oven, leaving them in for fifty minutes; they must be of a fine golden color and well-dried; after taking them from the oven, detach them carefully from the  paper,  and remove all the soft parts from the insides, using a teaspoon for this purpose, then lay them immediately on a raised edged tin sheet, one beside the other, the hollow part uppermost, and keep them in a warm heater for twelve hours.

  (117). MINCE MEAT  (Mince Meat). 
Suppress all fibers and  skin  from half a pound of  beef kidney suet,  chop it up very finely; have also chopped half a pound of cooked  ox heart;   seed  and pick half a pound of  Malaga raisins,  half a pound of Smyrna  raisins,  half a pound of  currants,  chop up three ounces of  citron,  cut three ounces of  candied orange peel  into three-sixteenth of an inch squares, peel and chop finely two pounds of  apples.  Have two ounces of  brown sugar,  half an ounce of ground  cinnamon,  a quarter of an ounce of grated  nutmeg,  a quarter of an ounce of  allspice  and ground  ginger,  and a quarter of an ounce of powdered  coriander seeds,  one pint of  cider,  one gill of  rum,  quarter of a gill of  brandy  and the peels and juice of two  lemons.  Mix all the ingredients together and put them into a stone crock leaving it in a cool place for at least fifteen days before using.  
  
  (118). TO TURN, CHANNEL AND FLUTE MUSHROOMS  (Pour Tourner et Canneler les Champignons). 
Choose the freshest  mushrooms  and those of equal size, cut off the stems, wipe well the  heads,  and take them one by one in the left hand, the hollow side underneath, then with the tip of a small pointed knife cut away the peel in regular rings without destroying the  mushroom,  and turn from right to left pressing all the time against the tip of the small knife; this must be done quickly and let us observe that it is not on the first trial that a  mushroom  can be properly turned, it takes practice to accomplish this properly. As quickly as each one is done, throw it into a saucepan containing cold, acidulated  water,  just sufficient to cover, then drain off the  water,  and cook the  mushrooms  for seven or eight minutes with the lid on, adding  salt,   butter  and  lemon juice,  to keep them as  white  as possible. As for fluting  mushrooms,  this art is only learned after long  experience.  Mushroom  fluting has become almost a profession, and the difficulties to be overcome can be better understood on examining those pretty  mushroom heads  so delicately carved, we see displayed by all  preserve  manufacturers.  
  
  (119). TO STONE OLIVES  (Pour &#201;nucl&#233;er les Olives). 
If the  olives  are plump, large and contain small stones, these can be removed with a machine made for the purpose ( Fig.  63) or with a tube from a column box, but generally the  meat  is cut off in spirals around the stone by means of a small knife. After the stone is removed, the  olives  resume their former shape, then plunge them into  boiling water,  and take them out again at once; they must be blanched without boiling.

A round bottomed saucepan or basin is far preferable to the flat ones, which are in general use.  
  
  (140). PLAIN MERINGUE PREPARATION AND WITH COOKED SUGAR  (P&#226;te &#224; Meringue Ordinaire et Avec Sucre Cuit). 
The preparation for meringues is composed of twelve or fifteen  egg-whites  for each pound of  powdered sugar;  set these  whites  in a basin with a grain of  salt  and beat up with a  whip,  very slowly at first, but increasing the velocity of the movement as the quantity becomes greater. The beaten  whites  should be stiff and remarkably smooth; then mix in the  sugar  a little at a time, using a wooden spoon for the purpose.   Italian Meringue with Cooked  Sugar.   -Cook one pound of  sugar  to "ball"  (No. 171) ; incorporate a very little of it at a time into six beaten  whites,  without ceasing to stir; when all the  sugar  is absorbed work it for two minutes longer on a slow fire to have it very smooth.

Noodle  Paste  for Borders.  -The same preparation as for the above, the only difference being that the five whole  eggs  are replaced by ten  yolks.  This  paste  can also be used for covering dish bottoms.    Paste  for Fastening on Borders (Rep&#232;re).  -This is simply sifted  flour  diluted with beaten  egg  and passed through a fine wire sieve to obtain a sufficiently liquid  paste  that can be pushed through a cornet. It should be consistent enough not to run.  
  
  (143). OFFICE PASTE  (P&#226;te d'office). 
Sift one pound of  flour  on the table, make a hollow in the center, and in this lay half a pound of  sugar,  two whole  eggs  and four  yolks.  Mix all together to form a smooth  paste,  knead it twice, and let it rest in a cool place before using it.  
  
  (144). PIE PASTE (COLD)  (P&#226;te &#224; P&#226;t&#233;) (froid). 
This is prepared with melted  butter  as follows: Sift a pound of  flour,  form a hollow in the center and in it lay four  egg-yolks  and the third of an ounce of  salt  dissolved in a little  water.  Melt eight ounces of  butter,  pour the clear part slowly into the hollow, then work the  flour  gradually into it, adding the necessary  water  and knead the  paste  at ounce, roll it into a ball and leave to cool. This  paste  is far mellower than when made with  cold butter.   Another proportion for cold pie  paste  is to have one pound of  flour,  four ounces of  butter,  four  eggs,  tepid  water  and  salt;  prepare and finish as above.  
 
  
  (145). PASTES FOR HOT PIES  (P&#226;tes &#224; P&#226;t&#233;s Chaud). 
Lay in a circle on the table one pound of sifted  flour;  make a hollow in the center and into this put a third of an ounce of  salt  dissolved in a little  water,  eight ounces of  butter,  two  egg-yolks  and two gills of  water.  Mix first the  butter  with the  eggs  and  water,  add the  flour  working it in a little at the time, also pour in a little  water  as it becomes necessary, being careful not to get the  paste  too thin, and still avoid being too dry, otherwise it will not hold together well; knead the dough twice, detach it from the table and form it into a ball on the  flour ed table, and when smooth, cover and let it rest.  Another recipe is: one pound of  flour,  eight ounces of  butter,  half a pint of  water,  four  egg-yolks,  and a third of an ounce of  salt  dissolved in  water;  to be prepared the same as the above.  
  
  (146). PUFF PASTE AND HALF PUFF PASTE  (P&#226;te Feuillet&#233;e et demi Feuillet&#233;e). 
This  paste  is actually not so very difficult to make, only it requires particular attention. Weigh one pound of the very best quality, not too fresh, but well dried  flour;  one pound of  butter,  well drained and cooled on the ice, then kneaded in a cloth to make it become flexible. Sift the  flour  on to the table, arrange it in a circle, and put into this one teaspoonful of  salt  and a glassful of  water.  With the right hand mix gradually the liquid with the  flour,  adding more  water  when necessary, so as to obtain a smooth, even  paste,  soft in preference to  hard,  and of a consistency neither stringy nor ropy; as soon as the dough is made, knead it well for two minutes, detaching all the small particles from the table, but if the  paste  be well made it should adhere neither to the table nor to the hand; cover it with a cloth and let it rest for twelve minutes. Dredge the table lightly with  flour,  lay the  paste  on top, and roll it out square shaped, roll out the  butter  likewise, lay it in the center of the  paste,  on top, then bring the four outer edges back on to the  butter  so as to inclose it well ( Fig.  64); take a pastry rolling pin, apply it on the  paste,  and using the two hands push the  paste  and  butter  forward, rolling it out to the thickness of three sixteenths of an inch or thereabout, keeping it straight on both sides as represented in the following design ( Fig.  65). Fold this band into three, press it down with the rolling pin to compress it, the accompanying design will show how to fold it ( Fig.  66). The  paste  has now only received one turn; to fold it once more, give it a half turn so as to lengthen it to the same thickness, but in a contrary direction, as thin as before; then fold the  paste  in three, cover it and let it rest for ten or twelve minutes; the  paste  will now have received two turns, then give it two turns more, exactly the

  FIG. 66.  An illustration of Different Stages in making a Puff Paste.  
  same as the others, and let it rest each time for ten minutes. Before giving the last two necessary turns to fine  puff paste,  it must have already had six, if more are given it will be found detrimental to its delicacy.  One special obstacle to be absolutely avoided during the operation is not to let any  butter  whatever escape from the folds of the  paste,  which might easily occur if the  paste  happens to be too soft, if rolled out too thin, if not rolled out regularly in smooth layers, and if it is thicker on one side than the other. In summer it is very difficult to obtain good  puff paste  without the use of ice or at least without a cold cellar; in any way this inconvenience can be obviated by substituting good  beef kidney suet  for  butter.  This  fat  must first be skinned, then soaked in  cold water,  well drained, and pounded in a mortar, so as to convert it to a smooth  paste,  and then made supple by working it with the hands for a few minutes while wrapped in a cloth. If the  paste  should be made in moist, summer weather it must be laid on a cold baking sheet dredged with  flour,  and put aside in the ice box.   For Half  puff paste.   -The parings from  puff paste  make an excellent half  paste.  If this  paste  should have to be made, prepare a dough of three-quarters of a pound of  butter  for one pound of  flour,  operating exactly the same as for the  puff paste,  but giving it seven or eight turns instead of six.  
  
  (147). RAVIOLE PASTE  (P&#226;te &#224; Raviole). 
Lay a pound of sifted  flour  on the table, form a hollow in the center and in it place one ounce of  salt,  four  eggs,  two ounces of  butter  and a little tepid  water.   Another proportion is one pound of  flour,  one ounce of  salt,  two  eggs,  one ounce of  butter,  two heaping tablespoonfuls of grated  parmesan  and a little tepid  water.  The  paste  should be soft, yet not too firm, knead it well to have it smooth, lay it on a board, cover with a cloth and let it rest in a cool place for one hour, then roll out and finish making the ravioles.  
  
  (148). SAVARIN PASTE  {P&#226;te &#224; Savarin). 
One pound of  flour,  half a pound of melted  butter,  four ounces of  sugar,  eight  eggs,  six  yolks,  half an ounce of  yeast,  half a gill of raw  cream,  and a pinch of  salt.   Sift some of the  flour  into a warm vessel, and make a soft leaven with a quarter of the  flour  and the  yeast,  dilute it with tepid  water,  and cover it with some more of the  flour,  then leave it to rise in a warm temperature. When the leaven has risen to half its original size, break up the dough with the hands, and work into it gradually, and one by one the  eggs  and the remainder of the  flour,  then knead the dough vigorously for ten minutes to give it a body, add to it slowly the melted  butter,  afterward the  sugar  and  salt,  and lastly the raw  cream;  the zest of  lemon  chopped or grated may be added if desired.  
  
  (149). TART PASTE  (P&#226;te &#224; Tarte). 
Make a  paste  on the table with three-quarters of a pound of  flour,  a quarter of a pound of  arrowroot  or fecula, half a pound of  butter,  three  egg-yolks,  two gills of  cold water  and a tablespoonful of  sugar,  adding a little  salt.  When the  paste  is smooth, wrap it up in a cloth, and leave it to rest for twenty-five minutes.  
  
  (150). TIMBALE PASTE  (P&#226;te &#224; Timbale). 
Mix one pound of  flour,  three-quarters of a pound of  butter,  four or five  egg-yolks,  one grain of  salt,  and one gill of  water.  Form a  paste,  reserving a little of the  water.  Knead it well, then add slowly the rest of the  water,  roll it out, and set it aside to rest under a cover.  
  
  (151). SMALL PUFF PATTIES  (Petits P&#226;t&#233;s Feuillet&#233;s). 
Make a  puff paste  the same as for  puff paste  (No. 146), giving it six turns, roll out the  paste  to three-sixteenths of an inch in thickness, let it rest awhile, then from it cut about fifteen round pieces, using a smooth pastry cutter one and three-quarters to two inches in diameter; collect the parings together at once, roll them out with the rolling pin to one-eighth of an inch thick,
  Fig. 67, FIG. 68, FIG. 69.  An illustration of Different Utensils used in Cutting Pastry.  
  and cut the same quantity of round pieces with the same cutter, turn them over on to a wet baking sheet in straight rows, a small distance apart, and lay on each one, a one to one and a quarter inch ball of  veal  Godiveau  forcemeat,  or one of  fish,   chicken,   game,  with or without  chives.  Moisten the  paste  around the garnishing, cover each one with the pieces that were cut first, pressing them down to make the two layers of  paste  adhere together all around the garnishing; flatten the  paste  with the back of a small one and a half inch pastry cutter,  egg  the tops using a soft brush, and cook these small patties in a well heated oven.  
  
  (152). TO POACH QUENELLES, SMALL TIMBALES AND MOUSSELINES  (Pour Pocher les Quenelles les Petites Timbales et les Mousselines). 
 Quenelles.  -Quenelles are poached by pouring hot (nearly boiling)  water  into a sautoire by the side of the quenelles, set the sautoire on the fire to bring the liquid to a boiling point, and at the first boil, cover the sautoire, remove it to the side of the range so that the  water  only quivers, and take out the quenelles with a skimmer as soon as they are firm. The length of time to poach quenelles depends upon their size; either ten to fifteen minutes. Dry them on a cloth before dressing.   Small Timbales.  -Range the timbales in a sautoire; fifteen minutes before serving, fill it to half the height of the molds with  boiling water,  and set the sautoire on the fire; when the  water  is ready to boil, remove and place it in a slack oven for ten or fifteen minutes; after a lapse of ten minutes touch the  forcemeat  in the center, and if firm, take them out, let stand for a little and invert the molds into a cloth to drain off all the liquid. Unmold.   Mousselines.  -Put these into a flat sautoire furnished with a perforated grater having the holes at regular spaces apart so that each one can receive a mold. The molds being rounded at the bottom, these holes are to keep them standing upright. Pour  boiling water  into the saucepan nearly sufficient to cover the height of the molds and stand it on the fire; when the  water  boils, remove and push it gently into a slack oven for ten or fifteen minutes, sufficient time to poach them slowly; they will be found done when touched in the center, they resist to the pressure of the finger, then take them from the  water,  stand them on one side to drain and unmold. If the oven be too hot the timbales rise, which must be avoided otherwise they lose their quality.  
  
  (153). TO PRESS MEATS, GALANTINES, BREASTS, SWEETBREADS, ETC.  (Pour Presser les Viandes, Galantines, Poitrines, Ris de veau, etc.). 
 For  Meat Juices.   -Have a press as shown in  Fig.  70. The  meats  intended for pressing should be done rare, but cooked through, so that all the  juice  can be extracted. There is also a press for pressing galantines,  sweetbreads,  etc. This one is made as represented in  Fig.  71; besides, there should be a double series of strips of wood, five inches across; the thinnest being a quarter of an inch thick, and the thickest are five inches; these are for the purpose of receiving the movable shelf belonging to the press so that all the pressed articles will be even throughout. For galantines it is also necessary to have a dozen tinned, sheet-iron sheets, a sixteenth of an inch thick, twelve inches long and six inches wide. These sheets are to be used when there are several galantines to equalize their thickness so that they are all pressed uniformly. The size of the press is thirty-eight inches high, twenty-eight inches wide and sixteen inches deep; the screw to be twenty-six inches long, and the wheel one  foot  in diameter. Press to the required thickness by arranging the strips either higher or lower; for galantines they are put an inch lower than the galantine itself; turn the screw slowly until the movable shelf rests on the two strips which are the thickness required. 
  FIG. 70, FIG. 71.  An illustration of Different Kinds of Presses used for Pressing Meats.  
   Sweetbreads   are pressed either in round or oval molds, proportionate to the size of the  sweetbreads;  place these molds, one beside the other, on a shelf of the same dimension as the movable one and fill each one with a piece of unlarded, braised  sweetbread  just sufficiently large enough to fill up the mold when pressed.    For  Breast of Mutton  or  Lamb,  Braised and Cooked.  -Range them on a board and press with a half inch thick strip on both sides to receive the movable shelf the same as the  sweetbreads.     Beef Tongues   are placed in a mold the shape of the  tongue,  it being two inches thick, eight and a half inches long and three and a half inches on its widest part. Molds containing two, four, or six  tongues  can be had.   Boned  Hams   are pressed in oval timbale molds.    Corned Beef   in square molds, two and a half inches deep.  
  
  (154). TO PREPARE DECORATED QUENELLES, MOLDED QUENELLES AND POCKET QUENELLES  (Pour Pr&#233;parer les Quenelles D&#233;cor&#233;es, Moul&#233;es et &#224; la Poche). 
Large decorated quenelles are used as a garnishing or to complete relev&#233; garnishings; they can be prepared with  chicken,   game  or  fish forcemeat.  These quenelles are made on pieces of buttered  white paper,  shaping them to any desired form with a small knife while smoothing the surfaces neatly. Large quenelles are usually decorated with  truffles  or red  beef tongue,  the former being preferable. The  truffle  decoration can be applied on to the quenelles either before or after poaching; in the first case the decorations are slightly incrusted into the  forcemeat  after wetting them with  egg-white;  the quenelles are then plunged into  boiling water  with the  paper  they have been molded on. If the quenelles are to be decorated after poaching then the pieces must be simply applied on, but first cover, or, better still, dampen one side with soft  forcemeat  so that they can adhere. Quenelles are poached in  salted water  without allowing it to boil. 
  FIG. 73, FIG. 73, FIG. 74.  An illustration of Different Patterns of Quenelles for the Purpose of Decorating.  
  Molded.  - Butter  some plain, oval-shaped, quenelle molds, using slightly melted  butter;  decorate the bottom of the mold the same as shown in the design. If required to be stuffed, then place a layer of  forcemeat  on the decoration and over this any salpicon whatever (see salpicons, No. 165), and finish to fill the mold; smooth the tops, stand the molds on a baking pan, pour enough  boiling water  in to fill the pan to half the height of the molds and then poach in a slack oven. These molds are simply buttered, filled with  forcemeat,  smoothed on top and poached. 
  FIG. 75, FIG. 76, FIG. 76A.  An illustration of Different Molds of Fancy Shapes and Designs used in Making Quenelles.  
  Pocket Quenelles.  -Mix together half as much quenelle  forcemeat  (No. 89), as  cream forcemeat  (No. 75), incorporating the latter gradually into the former, pass it all once more through a fine sieve, and fill a strong paper cornet with a third part of this  forcemeat,  push small quarter inch quenelles the shape of beads on to a buttered sheet, and then poach them in boiling,  salted water.  Color half of the remaining  forcemeat  with a little vegetal carmine, of a fine, light red color, and put this also into a paper cornet, and force them through on to another buttered sheet, letting these quenelles be channeled shaped, poach in salted,  boiling water.  Color the remainder of the  forcemeat  with  spinach green  or vegetal green to obtain a light pistachio color, and set them into a paper cornet also, and with it form oval shaped quenelles on to a buttered sheet, pour over some boiling,  salted water, and let them poach for a few minutes. These quenelles are used as garnishings for soups, and for a variety of entr&#233;es. 
  FIG. 77, FIG. 78, FIG. 79.  An illustration of Different Patterns Quenelles..  
 
 
  
  (155). TO MOLD QUENELLES WITH A SPOON, EITHER PLAIN, FILLED OR ROLLED IN FLOUR  (Pour Mouler les Quenelles &#224; la Cuill&#232;re, Simples, Four&#233;es ou Roul&#233;es &#224; la Farine). 
Select two common, large and very thin iron soup spoons, put one of these into a small panful of  hot water,  and taking the other in the left hand fill the hollow center with the  forcemeat,  smooth the top with the blade of a small knife dipped in tepid  water,  arranging it in such a manner that there is as much  forcemeat  above as below the level of the spoon, then remove the quenelles with the hot spoon sliding it beneath the  forcemeat,  then slip it at once on to the bottom of a buttered saut&#233;ing pan, without turning it over, so that the same side is on top. If the quenelles are wanted filled, prepare a montglas composed of  mushrooms,   tongue,   truffles  or foies-gras; thicken it with some very compact reduced, good  brown sauce,  so that when cold the preparation can be divided into small parts, and rolled into  olive  shaped pieces in the hand; in this case, when the spoon is filled with  forcemeat,  make a small hole with the finger on the surface so as to insert the montglas, salpicon or pur&#233;e, cover over with more  forcemeat,  being careful that it is the same thickness all over the filling, smooth it down nicely, and remove the quenelle with the hot spoon to slip it on to the bottom of a buttered saut&#233;ing pan without turning it over. Generally for one pound it will take eight large soup-spoonfuls, or sixteen dessert-spoons, or thirty-two tea-spoons, or sixty-four coffee-spoons. Poach these quenelles by pouring  hot water  into the saut&#233;ing pan beside the quenelles, and set the pan on the fire to bring it to boiling point; at the first boil, move it on one side, so that the  water  only simmers for six to fourteen minutes, according to their size. Lift the quenelles with a skimmer, and drain them on a cloth before using them.

  FIG. 81, FIG. 82, FIG. 83, FIG. 84.  An illustration of Quenelles in Different Shapes.  
  To Prepare Quenelles Rolled in  Flour.   -Divide some  game,   chicken  or  fish forcemeat  into pieces; roll each one on a  flour  dredged table into strings three-quarters of an inch in diameter; cut these into pieces three-quarters of an inch long; roll them on the table to give each one the shape of an  olive  or small  egg  half an inch in thickness and one inch in length. Larger ones can be made of Godiveau an inch and three-quarters long by five-eighths in thickness. Poach the quenelles in  boiling water  with  salt  added to it. The Godiveau quenelles are poached by ranging them at equal distances on a baking tin covered with a sheet of  paper,  then placing it in very slack oven.  
  
  (156). TO RAISE, PARE AND POACH BREASTS OF POULTRY AND GAME  (Pour Lever, Parer et Pocher les Filets de Volaille et de Gibier &#224; Plumes). 
Cut off the pinions from a clean, singed  chicken,  split the  breast skin  from one end to the other in the center, open it so as to disclose the flesh, then detach the  breasts  with a small knife following the  breast-bone,  and leaving the minion fillets adhering to them, removing them later if not needed. Take these  breasts  one by one, lay them the smoothest side uppermost on a table, press them down with the left hand and slip the blade of a knife between the flesh and the  skin,  so as to remove the latter at one pull without breaking it. Beat the  breasts  lightly with a damp knife handle, trim them in round half  hearts  on one end, and pointed on the other; remove the inside nerve, and the fine  skin  from the minion fillet, beat these lightly and lay them on the  inside surface of the  breasts,  if found necessary to enlarge them, but unless the  breasts  are very small, they are not added. They can be interlarded either with slices of  truffle  or  tongue,  by cutting five or six incisions across the minion-fillet and garnishing them with either of these. Proceed exactly in the same manner for  breasts of game.    To Poach.  -Place the  breasts  of poultry or  game  in a buttered sauteing pan; turn all the points toward the center and on them, place a sheet of buttered  paper,  put on the cover and set the pan in a slack oven leaving it in long enough to poach according to their size and quality.  
  
  (157). TO CLEAN CURRANTS, MALAGA AND SMYRNA RAISINS (Pour Nettoyer les Raisins de Corinthe, les Raisins de Malaga, et de Smyrne). 
Lay the  currants  on a table mixing in with them some  flour,  rub well together, then shake them through a coarse sieve, (No. 95) having eight meshes so that the small  currant  stalks pass through; wash well and dry them, then pick them over to free them of all the gravel stones which are generally to be found in these  fruits,  as well as the large stalks adhering to them.  Smyrna (Sultana)  raisins  are cleaned the same as  currants;  abstain from washing them.  Seed Malaga raisins  and pick off the stalks.  
  
  (158). RAVIOLES  (Ravioles). 
Roll out some raviole  paste   (No. 147) , very thin and in a perfect square; lay on top half an inch from the edge and one inch apart some  chicken  raviole  forcemeat balls   (No. 93) , three-quarters of an inch in diameter, after the entire flat is covered, moisten it lightly by passing a brush around the  forcemeat balls  and then place another flat of  paste  on top, it to be the same thickness as the under one and about four inches wider. Press on to this upper  paste  between the balls of  forcemeat  with a ruler and the whole length of the flat and then across so that every one of the balls is enclosed in a small square; cut each of these out with a channeled wheel or jagger ( Fig.  87). The jaggers are used for cutting lattice work bands for pies, or else replace it by a round channeled pastry cutter. Lay the cut pieces on a  flour  dredged saucepan lid and then drop them into  boiling water  to poach for about twelve minutes.

  (159). TO REDUCE AND STRAIN SAUCES THROUGH A TAMMY (Pour R&#233;duire les Sauces et les Passer &#224; l'&#201;tamine). 
  Fig. 88.  An illustration of Two People Straining Liquid from a Piece of Cloth into a Wooden Sink.  
The reason sauces are reduced is to give them the delicacy and succulence necessary to their finish, by incorporating into them fumets, stocks and the required condiments. The stocks that  are to be added to the sauces in order to reduce them should be as concentrated as possible so as to avoid any superfluous labor. In order to reduce a strained, despumated  sauce,  pour it into a flat saucepan having a thick bottom, set it on a brisk fire and let the  sauce  boil while stirring it well with a spatula, and pressing it down in a way that the  sauce  will fail to adhere to the bottom, and therefore burn. Mix in gradually the  stock  needed for its improvement, and continue to boil until it has acquired the necessary consistency and succulence, then take it off, and strain it through a tammy.  
  
  (160). RICE FOR CROUSTADES AND RICE WITH CREAM  (Riz Pour Croustades et riz &#224; la Cr&#232;me). 
Pick well four pounds of Carolina  rice,  put it into a newly tinned saucepan without washing it, adding a half pound piece of fresh  pork,  moisten it to three times its height with some  water;  heat the liquid on a moderate fire, and at the first boil, remove it to a slower one; twenty minutes after when the liquid is nearly all absorbed, cover the  rice  with a heavy buttered  paper,  close the saucepan, and set it at the opening of a slack oven, finish cooking the  rice,  drying it thoroughly, then remove the saucepan from the oven, take out the piece of  pork,  and work the  rice  while still in the saucepan, using a spatula for the purpose, then pound it again in a mortar so as to reduce it to a smooth  paste.  Lay this  rice  on a dampened marble slab, or a thick baking sheet, knead it with the hands so that it becomes smooth, mold it round shaped, and set it in a saucepan, buttered over with a brush, or else a mold proportionate to the size needed for the croustade. Press the  rice  down well, cover the top with a round sheet of buttered  paper,  and set it in the ice box for seven or eight hours, but not allowing the saucepan or mold to touch the ice. Unmold the  rice  after dipping the saucepan in  hot water,  cutting it out with a knife.    Rice  with  Cream.   -Blanch for a few moments half a pound of fine, picked and washed  rice;  drain and refresh, then put it back into the saucepan and moisten it with one quart of boiled  milk  in which a stick of  vanilla  has been infused. Let the liquid come again to a boil, cover the saucepan, and finish cooking the whole very slowly for forty minutes. When the  rice  is tender and has absorbed all the liquid, add to it a pinch of  salt,  three ounces of  sugar,  two ounces of fresh  butter  and a few spoonfuls of  whipped cream.  Sometimes a few  egg-yolks  are added to this  rice,  if so, they must be put in before any other of the ingredients, while the  rice  has all its heat, so that the  eggs  can cook while in the act of stirring them.  
  
  (161). TO PREPARE RISSOLES  (Pour Pr&#233;parer les Rissoles). 
Rissoles are prepared in two different ways, the first, by rolling out some fine  paste  or clippings of  puff paste,  into a long, thin piece from ten to fourteen inches wide; wet the bottom edges of this  paste,  then lay on it four balls of an inch and a quarter in diameter for the two and three-quarter inch rissoles made of rissole preparation, and from two and three-eighths inches distance apart from each other, and two inches from the edges; refold the  paste  forward, so as to cover up the prepared balls, and fasten the  paste  down to six-eighths of an inch around the balls; press on the two layers of  paste  to adhere them together, then cut out the rissoles half circular with a channeled pastry-cutter either two and one-quarter, two and one-half or two and three-quarters inches in diameter. As soon as the rissoles of the first row are cut, lay them aside; pare the edges of the  paste  and begin the operation again; reduce the height of the cut out rissoles by pressing them down with the finger without mishaping them. These rissoles may now be breaded and dipped in  egg,  or left  white;  in the first case, lay them simply on a tin sheet covered with a  white paper  till ready to fry. In the second, place them at some distance apart on a  flour ed cloth so that the  paste  cannot adhere to it. To prepare rissoles differently, roll out a thin flat, cut it into small round pieces with a channeled pastry-cutter either two and one-quarter, two and one-half or two and three-quarters inches in diameter, and on each one of these, lay a prepared rissole ball; wet the  paste  all round, and fold the piece of  paste  over the ball fastening the two edges together. Press the tops lightly with the fingers, keeping them a good shape, and lay the unbreaded ones on a  flour ed cloth, and the breaded ones on  white paper.  
  FIG. 89, FIG. 90.  An illustration of Rissoles Cut in Fancy Shapes.  
 
  
  (162). TO CUT ROOTS WITH A SPOON AND WITH A VEGETABLE CUTTER  (Couper les Racines &#224; la Cuill&#232;re et &#224; la Machine). 
Peel or scrape  carrots,  peel  turnips,   celery roots,   turnip-cabbage  or kohl-rabi,  sweet potatoes  or common  potatoes ; wash and keep them into  cold water  until needed; all of these vegetables  including peeled  truffles  can be cut  olive  shaped or in rounds large or small according to requirements ( Fig.  91). The rounds should be from a quarter of an inch to one inch in diameter; the long ovals from half an inch to one and a quarter inches. The oval spoons for this purpose may be either plain or channeled. When cutting vegetables with a spoon into either balls or  olives  dip the sharp end of the spoon into the thickest part of the root all through the depth and endeavor to remove the pieces as whole and perfect as possible. 
  FIG. 91, FIG. 92.  An illustration of a Spoon and a Vegetable Cutter.  
  Vegetable Cutter.  -( Fig.  92). This utensil is simple, practical and useful. It is used for cutting vegetables and roots into various shapes for soups or garnishing; having them pass by pressure through the deep cutters made of steel and movable so they can be easily changed when so desired. To proceed, first cut the roots into thin slices, all of equal thickness; place one of these on any one of the selected cutters; put this under the press and  bear  heavily on it. The pieces will fall through; pick out the imperfect ones; the others are ready to use.  
  
  (163). BLONDE AND BROWN ROUX  (Roux blond et brun). 
Roux is  flour  fried in  butter  and allowed to attain more or less color; it is used for thickening  gravies,  soup stocks and sauces; there are two kinds of roux, the blonde and the brown; the blonde is made as follows: Put into a saucepan to melt, one pound and two ounces of  butter,  add to it one pound of sifted  flour  and place the saucepan on a moderate fire to let it cook slowly while stirring until it becomes of a light blonde; this is used for velout&#233;. For the brown, leave it on the fire or in a slack oven until it assumes a darker color; should it not be necessary to use it at once, pour it into a vessel, and employ it as needed, but when required for immediate use, take it from the fire, leave it in the pan and let it lose a few degrees of its heat before moistening it. For a velout&#233;, dilute it with a  white  velout&#233;  stock,  and a brown espagnole  stock  if needed for brown; the proportions for both velout&#233; and espagnole being: one pound and two ounces of  butter,  one pound of  flour  and four quarts of either  white  or brown  stock.   
  
  (164). RUM FLAVORED WITH VANILLA; SPIRIT OF STRAWBERRIES, RASPBERRIES AND APRICOTS  (Rhum Vanill&#233;; Esprit de Fraises, Framboises et Abricots). 
  Rum  flavored with  Vanilla.   -Put twelve  vanilla beans  cut in pieces in a quart bottle with a quarter of a pint of  boiling water,  twelve hours later fill up the bottle with good  rum  and leave it for ten days; it will then be ready for use.    Spirit of Strawberries,  etc.  -Crush thirty pounds of  strawberries  or  raspberries;  to this  pulp  add three quarts of  spirits of wine,  put into an earthen crock, cover and leave to infuse for fifteen days. Distill the  fruits  in an alembic in a bain-marie and continue the distillation until the liquor reaches twenty degrees.  Spirit of apricots  is made the same way only taking twenty pounds of  fruit  instead of thirty for each three quarts of  spirit.  The  fruits  are pressed through a sieve and the kernels broken and crushed in a mortar, then mixed in with the  apricots.   
 
  
  (165). SALPICON; HOW TO PREPARE  (Salpicon; Mani&#232;re de le Pr&#233;parer). 
Salpicons are prepared with cooked and  cold meats  and  fish,  red  beef tongue,   sweetbreads  or  beef  palates; they are also made of  chicken  or  game  fillets, foies-gras, also with  truffles,   mushrooms,  c&#232;pes, and besides these,  oysters,   lobsters,   crawfish,  etc.  The characteristic of salpicon is that it is cut into small squares; they may be prepared with one kind of substance alone, but are generally mixed, for example:  chickens,  with red  beef tongue,   truffles  or  mushrooms;   game,  with foies-gras or  truffles,  and  fish,  with  mushrooms  and  truffles.  Salpicons are always thickened with a  sauce  corresponding to the nature of the  meat,  and in all cases it must be succulent and condensed.  
  
  (166). TO SCALD  (&#201;chander). 
In an analogous sense, scalding means to dip, to plunge in  boiling water.  A  pig,  a suckling  pig,   calf 's  head  and  feet  of either the  calf  or  sheep,   chicken's legs  and even whole poultry is scalded.  To scald a  pig  is to detach the bristles adhering to its back by means of  hot water,  done by dipping it once or twice in  hot water  to facilitate pulling them out more readily, then scrape the surface with a knife; this operation must be performed as quickly as possible. The same to be done for  calf 's  feet  and  head,  also for  sheep  and  lamb's  trotters. Poultry is sometimes scalded, but this system of treatment should be completely abandoned and the feathers picked off dry, this being far superior to the scalding process; for by scalding poultry, especially young  chickens  they become partially cooked and the  skin  is apt to tear when being trussed; they also contract a bad taste and decompose quicker than those that are dry picked.

  (168). SPICES, AROMATICS, AND SEASONINGS FOR COOKING PURPOSES  (&#201;pices, Aromates et Assaisonnements pour la Cuisine). 
The different articles employed as seasonings in kitchen work are comprised of  salt,   spices,  aromatics,  butter,   fat,   vinegar,   oil  and  mustard.   Salt  is without exception the most indispensable  seasoning;  it removes the insipid taste from  meats,  vegetables and all other eatables. It excites the appetite and helps digestion, but of course must be used with judgment, for too much is apt to make it unhealthy.  Coarse salt  is the one to be used for cooking boiled  meats  and vegetables. Finely pulverized  white salt  is for table use and the one used in kitchens for  seasoning  is merely crushed and sifted purified  salt.   Spices  are of different kinds; they are void of nutritious  properties and are only for the purpose of improving the taste of various foods. They are composed of common black and  white pepper,   cayenne pepper;  then come the weaker  spices  such as  nutmeg,   cinnamon,   cloves  and  coriander.  For  seasoning,  common raw  pepper,  ground only when ready to use is both agreeable and a tonic, but as much cannot be said for  pepper  cooked in stews, sauces or soups, for it loses its aroma while cooking and therefore only the acridity remains.  Peppers  that do not deteroriate while cooking are  paprika  (a Hungarian product), and  red pepper;  these both give a most agreeable flavor to stews and sauces, increasing as the cooking proceeds, and either of them are agreeable to the taste and a tonic without producing any irritating results.   Aromatics.  -Among the most aromatic plants used in the kitchen must be mentioned  bay leaf,   marjoram,   chives,   sage,   thyme,  wild  thyme,   savory,   tarragon,  pimpernel,  chervil,   pepper -cress,  parsley,   onion,   shallot,   garlic  and  horseradish root.  Some of these are used in a dry state, others in a fresh, and both are employed in numerous preparations. They can be used in saut&#233;s, braiz&#233;s, in sauces and even in soups. The action of these aromatics on the general health is only injurious when indulged in injudiciously or in too large quantities, but when employed with a certain reserve, they are both healthy, stimulating and agreeable.    Curry,  the Best, comes from India.  -An imitation  curry  is made of one ounce of  coriander seeds,  two ounces of  cayenne,  a quarter of an ounce of cardamon  seeds,  one ounce  salt,  two ounces of tumeric, one ounce  ginger,  half an ounce of  mace  and a third of an ounce of  saffron.    Prepared  Red Pepper   is made with  paprika  (Hungarian  red pepper ), and Spanish sweet  pimentos  mixed in equal quantities. In case  paprika  cannot be had use quarter  cayenne pepper  and three-quarters Spanish  pimentos.     Spices.   -Before grinding  spices  be careful that they are the freshest; grind each kind separately and sift them through a silk sieve, then mix thoroughly and put them into hermetically closed bottles, and set these in a cool place (they are only to be mixed when ready to use).    Spices  for  Bread Stuffing,   use two ounces of  sage,  one ounce of  marjoram,  half an ounce of  cayenne pepper,  half an ounce of  allspice,  one ounce of  thyme,  two ounces of  white pepper,  a quarter of an ounce of  nutmeg,  and half an ounce of finely minced  green celery leaf.     Spices  for  Game  Pies, and Galantines  are one pound of  cinnamon,  one pound of  nutmeg,  one pound of  cloves,  one pound of whole  peppers,  three ounces of  cayenne pepper,  three ounces of sweet  Spanish pepper,  three ounces of  thyme  and three ounces of  bay leaf.  These  spices  should be mixed in the proportion of one ounce to a pound of  salt.     Spices  for General Use.  -Two ounces of  cinnamon,  two ounces of  nutmeg,  two ounces of  cloves,  two ounces of  white pepper,  twelve ounces of  red pepper,  four ounces of  mace,  two ounces of  thyme,  two ounces of  sage,  two ounces of  marjoram,  two ounces of  rosemary.  One ounce of  spices  to two pounds of  salt.     Spices  for  Turtle  Soup.  -Two ounces of  curry,  half an ounce of  thyme,  two ounces dry  mushrooms,  half an ounce of  sage,  a quarter of an ounce of  mace,  half an ounce garden  citron,  half an ounce of  basil,  half an ounce  marjoram,  half of the peel of a chopped  lemon,  two ounces of  white pepper.  These aromatics and  spices  are used when there is no time to prepare a  stock,  or when preserved  turtle  has to be used. Two ounces of  spices  to one pound of  salt.     Spices  for  Goose Liver  Patties (P&#226;t&#233; de foies gras).  -Four ounces of  nutmeg,  four ounces of  cloves,  four ounces of  basil,  four  marjoram,  four of  thyme,  two and a half ounces of  black pepper,  three ounces of  white pepper,  two and one-third ounces of  bay leaf,  two and a half ounces of  mace,  two and a half ounces of  ginger,  two and a third of  coriander seeds,  one and two-thirds ounce of sweet  pepper.  One ounce of these  mixed spices  to every two pounds of  salt.   
  
  (169). STEARINE; HOW TO CAST AND COLOR IT (St&#233;arine; Mani&#232;re de la Couler et de la Colorer). 
Casting stearine in plaster molds is most simple and only requires a little attention. Tinned copper molds should be smooth in the inside and even polished. Put all the plaster molds in a vessel after separating each piece and leave them in tepid  water  for half an hour or longer according to their size. For tinned copper molds coat them first with a thin layer of stearine, then place another layer on this first one and continue until the stearine be sufficiently thick. The stearine must be melted in a bain-marie or on a slow fire, being careful to keep it stirred and also not to heat it too violently so that it remains  white,  for if too greatly heated it turns yellow and thereby loses its beautiful  white  appearance; if this should happen it should only be used to coat the inside of large pieces or else for pads for filling the inside of borders. To cast stearine in plaster molds, take the molds from the  water,  drain them out for a moment and then fit each piece into its respective place; tie around firmly, fill up with the melted stearine and when a light crust has formed on the surface, break it and empty out the mold; let rest for one minute, put it back into the  water,  remove and unmold with the greatest care. Should the unmolded pieces fail to be smooth or else be creased, this is caused by the stearine not being sufficiently warm and the molds too cold, and that the stearine was cast too slowly. This is of great importance to observe and is most essential when perfection is required. When the objects intended for casting are frail, such as rings, arms, figures or other thin pieces, it will be advisable to insert thin wires into these parts before casting the stearine in the mold. After unmolding the subjects, wash the mold well, being careful that no particles of stearine remain in the joints, so that it can be thoroughly closed and the stearine cannot escape through these joints. Scrape the seams or moldings carefully. Stearine subjects can be colored with one or more colors; for this purpose use  water  paints (tubes in preference). This kind is mostly employed for this work and to it add a little  beef gall  to enable the paint to adhere on to the greasy surface. Use a soft badger brush and proceed with care; always wait until the first coat be dry before applying another. With a little taste and skill subjects can be painted so that a great effect is produced, especially for the larger ones. When required to be bronzed, mix a few drops of gum arab with a little of the  gall,  add bronze powder and a little  water;  stir well, keeping it the consistency of  honey.  Paint over the subject with a camel's hair brush and if one coat be not sufficient then give another, adding a little more  water.   
  
  (170). TO STRAIN PUR&#201;ES  (Pour passer les pur&#233;es). 
  FIG. 90.  An illustration of two People Straining a Piece of Cloth with a Spoon into a Wooden Sink.  
Vegetable,  chicken,  crustacean, and  game  pur&#233;es are strained through a tammy ( Fig.  99) in order to obtain them as fine as possible. To accomplish this it will require the service of two persons: take hold of the tammy on both sides, pour the pur&#233;e into its hollow center, then have two wooden spoons one laying in the other, and press them vigorously against the tammy, allowing the pur&#233;e
  Fig. 99a, Fig. 99b.  An illustration of Different Kinds of Wooden Strainers.  
  to fall into a deep dish set underneath; this is easily accomplished and depends entirely upon the regular motion of the two spoons, as they must advance backward and forward without getting separated, or use either one of the machines shown in  Figs.  99a and 99b.  
  
  (171). TO COOK SUGAR  (Pour cuire le sucre). 
In former days  sugars  were less refined than in our time, therefore it was most important that they should undergo the operation of clarification, or, as the very word implies rid them of their impurities and make them perfectly clear. To-day this operation is almost useless, however, in case of necessity we will give the exact manner of proceeding, for it may sometimes be found useful. Put twenty pounds of  sugar  into a copper basin, melt it with two-thirds of its quantity of  water,  or one-half pint of  water  to each pound of  sugar,  set it on the fire, and when the scum begins to rise, throw in some  egg-whites  beaten up with  water,  the proportions being one  white  for each quart of  water;  do not stir it again, but let it rise to the surface twice, then pour in half a pint of clear  water  without  eggs;  let it rise a third time, and as it does so, remove from off the fire and skim it. Return it to one side of the fire to let it boil and drive the scum on one side of the basin, skim this off as quickly as it gathers. Soon the  sugar  will become very fine, clear and transparent, but if otherwise, then let it boil till it clarifies thoroughly and pass it through the flannel bag.  Sugar  clarified by this process is ready to be submitted to all kinds of cooking which we explain further on. The cooking of  sugar  is easily measured by a thermometer, but a clever workman will quickly find it out by the mere touch. These various cookings take different names which we will now endeavor to explain.   First -Liss&#233; ou Petit Filet or Small Thread.  -Cook the  sugar,  and in order to be sure that it has reached the first cooking, take out a little of the  sugar  with a spoon, dip the index finger in it and apply the finger to the thumb; separate the two fingers immediately, the  sugar  should then form a small thread, the thermometer marking two hundred and fifteen degrees Fahrenheit, (one hundred and one degrees Centigrade).   Second -Grand Liss&#233; or Large Thread.  -At two hundred and seventeen degrees, the  sugar  stretches a little more between the fingers, it is now cooked to large thread (one hundred and two degrees Centigrade).   Third -Petit Perl&#233; or Little Pearl.  -The  sugar  reaches this cooking when between the two fingers it stretches and forms a thread that breaks. The thermometer is then two hundred and twenty degrees (one hundred and five degrees Centigrade).   Fourth -Grand Perl&#233; or Large Pearl.  -As soon as the  sugar  extends from one finger to the other without breaking it has reached large pearl, two hundred and twenty degrees Fahrenheit (one hundred and six Centigrade).   Fifth -Au souffl&#233; ou  Glue,  or the Blow.  -Dip a skimmer into the  sugar,  knock it at once against the edges of the basin, blow through the skimmer so as to make the small bubbles fly out, and when they do so properly, the  sugar  has reached its degree of cooking. The thermometer now marks two hundred and thirty degrees Fahrenheit (one hundred and ten degrees Centigrade).   Sixth -Petit Boul&#233; or Small Ball.  -Dip the finger first into  cold water,  then in the  sugar,  and immediately into  water;  if the  sugar  has reached to proper cooking or small ball, it can be rolled into a soft ball between the fingers, two hundred and thirty-six to two hundred and thirty-eight degrees Fahrenheit (one hundred and fourteen to one hundred and fifteen degrees Centigrade).   Seventh -Grand Boul&#233; or Large Ball.  -When the thermometer reaches two hundred and forty-six to two hundred and forty-eight degrees Fahrenheit or one hundred and nineteen to one hundred and twenty degrees Centigrade, then the ball instead of remaining soft when rolled between the fingers, becomes solid and  hard,  the  sugar  has now reached large ball.   Eighth -Petit Cass&#233; or Small Crack.  -Dip the tip of the finger into  cold water,  then into the  sugar  and rapidly into  cold water  again, so as to detach it from the finger; if it has reached its proper cooking it should break. The thermometer is now two hundred and ninety degrees Fahrenheit (one hundred and forty-three degrees Centigrade).   Ninth -Cass&#233; or Crack.  -Letting the  sugar  boil a few minutes longer, it will reach the crack; now dip the finger into  cold water,  then into the  sugar,  and again into the  water,  the  sugar  must break between the teeth without adhering to them. It reaches this degree when the thermometer is at three hundred and ten degrees Fahrenheit (or one hundred and fifty-four degrees Centigrade).    Tenth. Grand Cass&#233; or Large Crack or  Caramel.   -This last cooking is exceedingly delicate and requires the most particular care, so as to avoid having the  sugar  turn black which it is apt to do very easily. When reaching this last cooking, the  sugar  slightly loses its whiteness and assumes a shade scarcely perceptible to the eye; this is when the thermometer reaches three hundred degrees Fahrenheit, and it is now time to add to each twenty pounds of  sugar,  a teaspoonful of  lemon juice.  Continue the cooking and when the thermometer reaches three hundred and forty-five to three hundred and fifty degrees Fahrenheit, then remove the basin quickly from the fire, and instantly pour its contents on a marble to get cold.  These are the various degrees the cooking of  sugar  undergoes, practice alone makes perfect in this particular work, which can only be acquired after much study and attention.  
  
  (172). SUGARS OF DIFFERENT COLORS, AND ICING SUGAR (Sucres de Diff&#233;rentes Couleurs et Sucre &#224; glace Impalpable). 
 For Pink,  have  powdered sugar  from which icing  sugar  has been sifted, spread it on a baking-sheet covered with  white paper,  lay the tin on top of a very moderate fire, and pour into it sufficient carmine to give it the necessary color; mix and rub it slowly between the hands until the moisture contained in the carmine be entirely evaporated, then sift it through a sixteen mesh sieve ( Fig.  97).   For Yellow.  -Prepare the  sugar  the same as for the pink, using Breton vegetal yellow.   For  Orange.   -The same as the pink, coloring with Breton vegetal  orange,  or yellow and red mixed to imitate  orange.    Lilac and Violet.  -The same as the pink, coloring it with red and ultramarine blue, or else with Breton vegetal lilac or violet.   Blue.  -Breton vegetal blue and ultramarine blue.   Green.  -Breton vegetal green, or else  spinach green  or watercress green.   Icing  Sugar.   -There are very few cities where  powdered sugar  is unobtainable, also icing  sugar  (confectionery  sugar ), but in case it has to be prepared at home the following remarks will be found useful. Pound some lump  sugar  to the finest powder, pass it through an ordinary sieve, then through an icing sieve called a  drum;  this latter includes two sieves, one for passing ordinary  sugar  and another much finer for passing the icing  sugar,  meaning exceedingly fine  powdered sugar  almost impalpable.  
  
  (173). BAND TART  (Tourte &#224; bande). 
Roll out on a  flour ed table, a layer of foundation  paste  (No. 135), cut in this a round, eight inches in diameter, lay this round on a small baking-sheet, moisten the border with a brush, and apply on this wet part, a puff- paste  border having received six turns, five-eighths of an inch in thickness, one and one-half inches wide and twenty-six inches long; cut the two ends bias, fasten them together after slightly dampening them and set the  tart  aside in a cool place for fifteen minutes. Prepare an  egg  wash of well beaten whole  eggs,  or the  yolks  alone diluted in a little  cold water,  apply it to the border, prick the inside or else put in a small mold, to prevent it inflating, then set the  tart  in a hot oven the same as for a vol-au-vent for thirty or forty minutes. After removing it from the fire, detach it from the sheet, and lay it on a dish to keep warm. 
  FIG. 100.  An illustration of a Round Mold.  
 
  
  (174). EMPTY TARTS, ANCIENT STYLE  (Tourtes &#224; l'Ancienne). 
Spread on a baking-sheet a layer of foundation  paste  eight inches in diameter; wet the edges of this crust using a brush, and lay on the center a spherical shaped pad, four and three-quarters in diameter and two and one-half high, made of  paper  and wrapped in slices of  fat pork.  Cover this pad with an upper layer of  paste  made with puff- paste  clippings, fasten the upper and   lower crusts together by pressing them down with the thumb, and cut away the surplus  paste  with the tip of a small knife, following the outlines of the lower crust. Moisten the edges of the crust and place it on a band of six turned  puff paste  (No. 147), an inch and a half wide, by twenty-six inches long, and three-eighths of an inch thick; cut off the ends on the bias, wet them slightly and fasten them together with the finger; channel the band lightly, decorate the dome with leaves cut from the  paste,   egg  the surface, also the band, and bake the  tart  for thirty to forty minutes in a well heated, but not too hot oven. After removing the  tart  from the fire, cut the dome at the base so as to remove the pad; it is now ready to fill.

  (175). THICKENINGS FOR SOUPS, SAUCES AND STEWS (Liaisons pour Potages, Sauces et Rago&#251;ts). 
 Thickening for Soups.  -Put some  egg-yolks  into a bowl, beat them up with a wooden spoon and dilute with a few spoonfuls of good raw  cream;  some  broth,  or  cold sauce;  pass this through a sieve or tammy, add a dash of grated  nutmeg  and a few bits of fine  butter.  Boil well the soup, remove it to one side of the range and mix in the strained thickening; return it to the hot fire, to let cook without ceasing to stir and especially without letting it boil.   For Sauces.  -This thickening is composed of  egg-yolks  beaten and diluted with some  cold broth  or raw  cream.  In order to thicken the  sauce,  it should necessarily be boiling, then remove it from the hot fire and stir a spoonful or more of it into the thickening, then pour the rest of the thickening into the  sauce  and cook it while stirring over a slow fire, without permitting it to boil. All sauces thickened with  eggs  must afterward be strained through a tammy.   Thickening or Liaison Prepared Ready to Use.  -Twenty-five  egg-yolks  for one quart of  cream;  mix well together, pass it through a fine strainer and keep it in a pot ( Fig.  171) in order to thicken sauces and stews as they are needed.    Butter  and  Cream  Thickening.  -Incorporate some  butter  and  cream,  and just when ready to serve, stir it vigorously (do not heat it again), and serve it at once.   Blood Thickening.  -Reserve the blood of poultry or  game,  adding to it a little  vinegar  to prevent it from coagulating, then strain it through a sieve and stir it in gradually when needed to thicken a  sauce.     Arrowroot,  Fecula and  Cornstarch  Thickening.  -Dilute one or the other of these with some  water,   broth  or  cold milk;  strain through a sieve, and pour it into the liquid, stirring it continuously.   Thickening of Kneaded  Butter.   -Incorporate as much  flour  into  butter  as it will absorb to form a soft  paste;  mix it in small parts in the  sauce,  stirring constantly until all the  butter  is melted.  
  
  (176). TO LINE AND BAKE TIMBALE CRUSTS  (Pour Foncer et Cuire les Cro&#251;tes &#224; Timbales). 
 Butter  a plain timbale mold, five inches in diameter at the bottom, five and a quarter across the top and five and a half inches deep. If the timbale is to be decorated, apply some bits of sweetened noodle  paste  against the sides and bottom of the mold, dampen them with a brush dipped in  water  and then line the timbale with a  paste  not rolled out too thin. With a pastry cutter, two inches in diameter narrower than the mold, cut the  paste  from the bottom, but do not remove it; cover the whole surface of the  paste  with buttered  white paper  and fill in the empty space with common  flour;  dampen the edges, and cover the top first with a round piece of buttered  paper,  and then with a layer of the same  paste,  fastening it down to the dampened sides.  Egg  over the surface, and let it rest for fifteen minutes in a cool place, then set the timbale on a round baking sheet and cook it for fifty minutes in a hot oven. After removing it, unmold, open the top (the end which before was the bottom), and lift up the round piece previously cut with the  pastry cutter, and which can easily be removed, then take out all the  flour  through this opening, also the  paper,  and brush the inside twice over with  egg-yolks,  then lay the timbale for a very few moments in a very hot oven so that it browns nicely, and range it on a dish to be garnished.  
  
  (177). TO BRUSH AND PEEL TRUFFLES  (Pour Brosser et Peler les Truffes). 
Put some raw, fresh  truffles  into  cold water;  wash them well, changing the  water,  then take them out one by one, and rub the surfaces over strongly with a  hard  brush, and throw them as fast as they are done into c lean water,  drain; take them out again one by one, and remove with a small knife all those parts the brush failed to touch, then refresh them leaving them as little as possible in the  water.  Wipe the  truffles  on a cloth, and with the tip of a knife detach all the  skin  covering them, cutting it away as thinly as possible, put the  truffles  as fast as they are done into a saucepan with a well-fitting lid; put also the peelings into a saucepan, and keep them in a cool place while waiting to be used.  
  
  (178). TO DRESS, SINGE AND TRUSS POULTRY AND GAME FOR ENTREES  (Pour Habiller, Flamber et Brider la Volaille et le Gibier &#224; Plume pour Entr&#233;es). 
After having dressed (drawn) and singed the pieces of poultry or  game,  remove the fork and breastbone, lifting it out through the  neck  without injuring the  breasts;  cut the  legs  below the joint, suppress the drumstick  bones,  and slip the  leg  into its place, having previously burned the top of the  leg  with  alcohol  so as to remove the outer  skin.  To truss either  capon,  young  turkey,  pullet,  chicken  or guinea- fowl : first, have a trussing needle threaded with some strong string, pass it through one  thigh  to the other and in the joint of the thick part of the  leg,  then cross through the  wing  directing the needle toward the  neck,  and take up the  skin  of the  neck  while passing through it, fastening it down to the back; pass through the other  wing,  tighten the string so that the  wings  and  thigh  are well attached to the body of the  fowl,  and the  breasts  are quite prominent. Secondly, with the needle cross through the back near the  rump,  direct the needle so that it passes the thickest part of the two  legs,  fasten the string strongly so that the  thigh  is well attached to the side, thrust the posterior inside, and tie it down with a few turns of a string. To prepare  geese  and tame  ducks  for entr&#233;es, suppress the  wings  and  neck,  singe and pick them, cut off the claws, truss the  legs  inside, and fasten them down by crossing through with the needle at the joints of the  thighs  and the stumps of the  wings;  give them a rounded appearance, and push the posterior into the inside, and tie it firmly in place. For  squabs,   partridges  and  quails : pluck the feathers, singe and lightly pick them and draw them through the pouch; then truss them by making an incision in the  rump,  and tie them the same as the  chickens.  
  FIG. 102, FIG. 103, FIG. 104.  An illustration od Different Stages of Dressing and Trussing Poultry.  
 
  
  (179). TO DRESS, SINGE AND TRUSS POULTRY AND GAME FOR ROASTING.  (Pour Habiller, Flamber et Brider la Volaille et le Gibier &#224; Plume pour R&#244;tir). 
Dressing poultry and feathered  game  consists of first bleeding, then plucking out the feathers, drawing, singing and trussing them. To dress a  chicken  it must first be singed lightly all over with  spirits of wine  set afire, or over a gas-jet, in order to remove every vestige of feathers. When the poultry or  game  is singed, then pick out all the feather-stumps remaining in the  skin.  Burn off the  skin  from the  legs  to enable it to be taken off with a cloth. To singe small birds stick them simply on small skewers four or six at a time and pass them over a flame. For drawing a  chicken  cut on the back of the  neck  making a long aperture through which the pouch and wind pipe can be removed; put the index finger into the interior following the  neck  to detach the  lungs  adhering to the inside; make a small opening next to the  rump  to empty the  chicken  entirely and then wipe out the insides, cut the  skin  below the  head,  chop the  neck  off on a level with the  breast  chop off the  feet  and the end of the pinions and cross the  wings  over the back of the  chicken.  Thread a long piece of string into a large trussing needle, lay the  chicken  on the table, pressing it down on its back, then with the open left hand take hold of the two  thighs,  so as to keep them held up at an equal height, pass through the flesh with the needle just below the  drum -sticks, turn the  chicken  over on its side to thread it through the  wings,  running the needle through the  breast skin;  pull the string tight tie it on the side with a knot, and lay the  chicken  once more on its back, press the  thighs  down again with the left hand and run the needle through above the drumsticks, then turn the  chicken  over on its side, and introduce the needle across the carcass, and at a quarter of the length of the bird near the  rump  to the other side, to meet the other end of the string and then tie it into a knot ( Fig.  106). In this manner the  chicken  is properly trussed, and both knots being on the same side, they are easily cut and the string pulled out when the  chicken  is cooked.  Pheasants,   partridges  and  pigeons  are to be trussed the same way when intended for roasting. After the poultry or  game  is trussed,  lard  it with thin slices of fresh  pork,  sufficiently large to cover the whole  breast,  pare them square shaped, score them lightly on one side, and lay them over the  breast,  fastening them on with a string as shown in  Fig.  109. 
  Fig. 105, FIG. 106, FIG. 107, FIG. 108, FIG. 109.  An illustration of Different Stages in Dressing a Poltry for roasting, shown from Different angles.  
   Wild Ducks  (Canvas Backs, Red  Heads,  Black  Heads,  Mallard, Ruddy, Teal, etc.).  -Select two fine red  head ducks,  pick them as far up as one inch from the  head,  being very careful not to tear the  skin;  singe and draw. In order to accomplish this, the  skin  must be cut the whole length of the  neck  from its beginning until the back of the  head  is reached, remove the pouch and windpipe, stick the finger in the  neck  far down in the inside to detach the  lights  from the  bones  and all adhering to the  breast,  make an incision above the  rump  and take out the  gizzard  drawing up the whole of the insides; cut the  neck  where it begins at the carcass, cutting the  skin  as far up as it is picked. Wipe the  duck  carefully, thrust the  feet  inside and season it interiorly with  salt  and mignonette. Should the  duck  be gamy it must have the inside washed out. Pick the feathers from the  head  and separate it where the  neck  finishes; pick out the eyes and place the  head  in the opening that was used for drawing the bird; truss the  duck  bringing the  feet  toward the front and passing the trussing needle threaded with string near

  the first joint of the  thigh  next to the  feet.  Run the needle through the  duck  under the  breast  and then across the other  thigh,  pressing the  duck  down well so as to round well the  breast,  bring the  neck skin  down on the back and run the needle on the bias through the pinion- bone  at the same time through the  neck skin  to pass it through the other pinion and return from whence it started, pull the string tight and push the  rump  inward, running the needle through to keep it in place, and bringing it back to one inch from its starting point, passing it through the  skin  and through the  head  by the eyes, fasten the two ends of string together tying them firmly.  
  
  (180). VOL-AU-VENT CRUST  (Cro&#251;te de vol-au-vent). 
Prepare a  puff paste  with one pound of fine, dry  flour  and one pound of good  butter,  proceeding as for  No. 146 ; give it six and a half turns, and when the  paste  is made, lay it on a  flour ed baking tin, and set on top of it a model of tin or heavy cardboard having the exact dimensions desired for the vol-au-vent, cut the  paste  all around this, with a small, heated knife, following the outlines of the model, but keeping the knife slightly inclined outward. As soon as the vol-au-vent is cut, turn it with one stroke upside down on to another dampened round baking sheet, being careful not to injure its shape; groove the edges lightly with the back of a knife as represented in the plate ( Fig.  112);  egg  the surfaces over, and trace a ring, using the tip of a small knife an inch and a half from the edge, then in the center of this ring trace four or five light incisions to form lozenges. Bake the vol-au-vent in a hot oven for thirty minutes or more according to its size, opening the oven as little as possible. When the  paste  is dry and a fine color, take it out, open it by lifting up the center cover, and empty it of all the uncooked  paste  within, lay the vol-au-vent on to a dish, and keep it warm in the heater, not allowing the crust to get cold before using it. Small vol-au-vent crusts may be prepared the same way, using a three and a half inch pastry cutter to cut them with.

  KITCHEN UTENSILS. 
  ROASTER AND SPITS (R&#244;tissoire et broches).  In large kitchens the only roaster possible is the one shown in Fig. 115 with its broad hearth, long spits, long hanging chains and wheels: an endless chain with a weight sufficiently heavy to rotate it, steam, electricity or hydraulic pressure can to be used advantageously to attain the same end. Fig. 117, represents a roasting spit for small game, quails, woodcocks, thrush, etc. It is provided with six skewers; run the game on to one of these through the two leg bones; use as much as possible the different sides for different games, for instance one side for quails, partridges or thrush and the other three skewers for snipe, woodcock, plovers, bustards, etc. These spita are very useful for large dinners, for eight quails can be put on each skewer or forty-eight quails can be roasted at once without having them too crowded. The length of the spit is sixty-eight inches and the length of each one of the six skewers is twenty inches. For cradle spit No. 116, the cut of meat to be roasted such as loin, the saddle

  FIG. 116, FIG. 117, FIG. 118.  An illustration of a Long Metallic Rod used in Holding the Meat for Roasting, Shown from Various angles.   
  is placed exactly in the center to regulate the weight evenly. The simple spit for poultry,  game,   turkey,  etc. is shown in  Fig.  118. A spit being at times an impossibility, one is frequently obliged to have resource to the more simple roasters. The greatest objection to the old fashioned shell roaster is that the spit did not turn alone, it had to be everlastingly turned for if left the  meat  would certainly spoil; a great improvement on this is the turning spring spit to be wound up like a clock and strikes an alarm when slackening by the movable balls of the fan striking on a gong ( Fig.  119). There are other roasters having two spoons turning at the same time as the spit feeding a small reservoir found on the top of the spit and through a shallow furrow perforated by small holes, the  meat  is continuously basted. The three pieces composing this oven are movable and can therefore be transported to any desirable place; the shell can easily be fastened on to the wall. There are also English spits adapted for all hearths ( Fig.  120); it is easy to fasten it to a movable hearth fitting with the spit. These are run by clock work placed on top; the roasts are suspended perpendicularly and always turn in the same direction. 
  FIG. 119.  An illustration of a Small Roaster with Poultry Meat on one of the Turning Spits Inside the Closeable Roaster.  
  FIG. 120.  An illustration of a Small hearth with a spit hanging from the top.  
  FIG. 121.  An illustration of a Wrought Iron pan with a Small Basket fitted inside used for frying purposes.  
  Fig.  121 represents a wrought or sheet iron pan; the interior has a basket which is used for frying small  fish,   potatoes , croquettes, etc. Place inside the objects intended for frying and plunge the basket into the frying  fat  after it has attained the required heat; the articles being cooked and of a fine color, withdraw the basket to drain them properly.   Fig.  122 represents a copper case containing four high saucepans called bain-maries. A bain-marie consists of a vessel filled with  boiling water  into which is placed another vessel containing the substances that are required to be heated. The materials placed in the second vessel can only acquire the temperature of the  boiling water  and heat gradually and progressively and therefore can be stopped at any time. Each saucepan should be ticketed with the name of the  sauce  it contains so that any  sauce  or soup can be selected without wasting time in searching for it. 
  FIG. 122.  An illustration of a Rectangular Copper Case with Four High Saucepans placed inside.  
  FIG. 123.  An illustration of a Small Oven attached to the Wall used in Glazing and Browning of Dishes..  
   Fig.  123. The salamander and oven hithertofore used in kitchens to glaze or brown dishes presented difficulties on account of the attention and watchful care it necessarily required. By means of the new gas salamander,  fish  can be almost instantaneously glazed when covered with a well thickened or buttered  sauce  without any danger whatever of having the  sauce  curdle. This salamander is lighted by gas and can be fastened to the wall at the back of the range. It consists of two platforms, the upper one fixed and the lower one movable and sufficiently big to place the largest dishes on it. Naturally the gas comes from the top and it is easy to regulate its intensity by a stop cock. Two minutes suffice too obtain a perfect glazing without having the bottom of the dish attain the slightest heat, thus the  sauce  cannot deteriorate whatever. It is an indispensable utensil and assists the cook greatly both as regards its usefulness and speed. 
  FIG. 124.  An illustration of a Small Rctangular Multi-Purpose Broiler.  
  Fig.  124 is the reproduction of a very useful broiler, offering numerous facilities for various purposes. The broiling takes place in a metal case, it being provided with five gas tubes, having the sides bored with small holes, the gas projects into small bells to have it purified and then can be used for broiling without the annoyance of smell nor smoke. It is principally used for broiling toasts, canap&#233;s, or toasts for sandwiches;  meats  can also be broiled thereon such as cutlets, chops and  beefsteaks.  When the bottom is closed with a movable door, it can be used for roasting  chickens,   legs of mutton,   beef,  etc. The top part is useful for keeping things hot. All gas stoves can be regulated and moderated, according to the work, by modifying or increasing the volume of gas. 
  FIG. 125.  An illustration of a Small Horn like appratus with Flame Burning from the thicker end.  
  Fig.  125 shows a singeing apparatus shaped like a horn; the largest part, from whence issues the flame is covered with a very fine metallic cloth which causes the flame to become enlarged. There is an opening on the other or thin end about an inch in diameter for the purpose of combining the air with the gas, forming a Bunsen burner. Poultry and  game  can be singed without blackening the  skin  whatever. 
  FIG. 126.  An illustration of a Large Steam table with covered dishes, cases and small sauce pans.  
  Fig.  126 is a steam table with covered dishes, cases and bain-maries. The square boxes are used for soups, stews, etc.; the covered dishes for large pieces of  meat  to be carved and for entr&#233;es; the small steamers are for keeping the sauces and  gravies.  Instead of a dish on the right, place a carving-board with a knife and fork. The inside is used for keeping the dishes hot before and after they are dressed. These steam tables are heated by steam or gas, and are advantageously used either as a hot closet or as a substitute for a chafing dish.  
 
  BROILER AND RANGE (Grillade et Fourneau).  The broiler shown below is most useful, for on it can be cooked all meats, either using charcoal, or embers, or gas. In olden times meats were broiled on the embers of a chimney hearth, fanning continuously to keep the fire alive. For many years sliding broilers have been used and charcoal. With gas the broiling is done in a metal case, by a gas tube having the sides pierced with small holes. Although gas is very little used in kitchens still it deserves to be encouraged; for not only does this style of broiling interest amateurs by its ingenuity, but it also has its particular advantages which are manifold, as the operation takes place without the slightest trouble and without having the meats give forth any smoke or disagreable smell, for the heat attains the meat from the top and all the escaping fat falls into a receptacle Fig. 127 shows an improved range an explanation of which is unnecessary. 
  FIG. 127.  An illustration of a Very Large Broiler with Different Parts for Broiling Different Meats.  
  FIG. 128.   An illustration of a Small Broiler with a Side Door and a Handle on the Top.  
 
  PORTABLE HEATER(&#201;tuve Portative).   This heater is used for transporting meats out-outside or keeping hot dishes to be served. It is heated with small cakes of prepared coal, made red-hot in the hearth of the range, then put into a small sheet-iron box placed at the bottom of the heater. They can also be heated with an alcohol lamp. The heaters are made of tin and provided with two gratings inside; they can be of any size (Fig. 128).

In this same shaped pot all systems can be employed. The one shown on the figure has a double jacket; on top place a ring and in this a tinned basin; fill it half full of boiling water and use it for cooking ices; stocks, broths and consomm&#233;es are cooked in those having a ball in the center, or else a winding pipe, but the ball is preferable. For cooking potatoes, lobsters, terrapin, etc., iron pots with rounded corners are used; on the bottom is an iron winding pipe furnished with holes; at the bottom is a hole for letting the water from the condensed stream run out, on top a hinged cover sufficiently heavy to close it hermetically, specially required for these kind of pots.  
  SAUTOIR, SAUCEPAN, SOUP POT, BRAZIERE (Sautoir, Casserole, Marmite, Braisi&#232;re).  Fig. 130 represents a flat, thick copper saucepan, generally called a sautoir; they are also made of a thinner copper and are intended for saut&#233;ing fillets of chickens, &#233;scalops, cutlets, etc. It is neccessary to have these of all sizes, large as well as small.  Fig. 131 represents a copper saucepan tinned in the interior and furnished with a cover fitting inwardly. These also must be of all sizes according to the importance of the work to be executed.

  FIG. 134.  An illustration of a Long Stew pan with Rounded Curds and Handles.  
  Fig.  133 represents a soup pot for broths with side handles, with or without a faucet, serving to draw off the liquid. Copper pots are preferable to iron or earthen ones, the first give the  broth  or soup a dark color and the latter in time acquire a bad taste.   Fig.  134 represents a braisi&#232;re or long stew pan having rounded ends and handles. Its deep cover is made to hold hot embers, but this is not necessary if the braizing is done in the oven, then a well fitting cover will be found sufficient.  
  FISH KETTLE (Poissonni&#232;re).  Fig. 135 represents a fish kettle, these are either of copper or tin. The fish is placed on a metal sheet perforated with half inch holes, this has handles on both sides, it is put down into the bottom of the fish kettle and lifted again when the fish is cooked, thus avoiding the breaking of it.  Fig. 136 represents oblong shaped, deep baking pans having handles on each end. These pans are furnished with a perforated metal grate. Their raised edge cover (Fig. 136), can when turned upside down, also serve for a deep pan suitable for cooking flat fishes, fricandeaux sweetbreads, etc.   Fig. 137 represents a series of six small timbales with flat bottoms ranging from No. 1 to No. 6. These timbales as shown in the figures are just half their actual size.  Fig. 138 shows a series of convex molds for mousselines, No. 1 to No. 6.

  BASIN (Bassine).  Basins are made of copper; as a general rule they are not tinned. In large kitchens there are some that are tinned and others that are not. If untinned they can also be used not only for beating up egg whites, cooking fruits, and jellies, but also for blanching and cooking green vegetables, such as spinach, green peas, string beans, etc., thereby retaining their natural color, giving them a more appetizing appearance. 
  FIG. 140.  An illustration of a Large Round Basin with Handles on both the Sides.  
 
  KITCHEN SIEVES(Tamis de Cuisine).  
  An illustration of Different Sizes of Kitchen Sieves.    
 It is impossible to perform any kitchen work without the use of large and small sieves. Sieves and colanders are indispensable either for straining pur&#233;es, forcemeats,  gravies  and broths, for draining purposes or when required to be laid aside for further use.  
  MOLDS (Les Moules).   The Fig. 144 and 145 represent two fancy jelly molds; they are cylindrical shaped, having a cover of the same size, hollow on top so that it can hold chopped ice. Many dessert molds are to be found in the market unprovided with covers, thereby making them useless and inconvenient. The Fig. 146 shows the cover of the mold seen upside down having a small piece adjusted to the center which fits into the cylinder of the mold. 
  FIG. 144, FIG. 145, FIG. 146, FIG. 147.  An illustration of Different Copper Molds used for Making Jellies and Macedoines.  
  Fig.  147 is a copper mac&#233;doine mold with a tinned double copper bottom. This double bottom is movable and is kept at an even distance from the sides and bottom of the mold by three catches attached to it. If the double bottom be removed it then can be used for aspics of foies gras, unmolding it on to a  jelly  border having a support placed in the center.  
 
  JUICE PRESS (Presse Sucs).  These presses are for extracting all the liquid parts of fruits needed for preparing syrups and fruit jellies, such as currants, raspberries, blackberries, strawberries and barberries, in fact all fruits. This utensil should be made of wood for all red fruits lose their natural color when brought in contact with any metal.

  JELLY AND BABA MOLDS(Moules &#224; Gel&#233;e; et Moules &#224; Baba).   Jelly molds are made both of copper, tinned in the inside, fancy and cylindrical, and are used for thick creams, blanc-manges, flamris, etc. Three or four are not too many to have in a kitchen. Baba molds are of copper, tin and earthen-ware; they are cylindrical shaped and generally have deep furrows in them, but can be of any shape (Fig. 149).  
  "PAIN" AND PUDDING CYLINDRICAL MOLDS (Moules Cylindriques &#224; Pain et &#224; Pouding).  These are cylindrical shaped, tinned on the inside. Generally puddings are cooked in these molds, but they can also be used for rice or fruit pains, besides they are very useful in a kitchen either for hot entr&#233;es or else molding hot or cold sweet dishes. Dome shaped molds can also be used to poach pains and puddings (Fig. 150). 
  FIG. 150, FIG. 151, FIG. 152.  An illustration of CYlindrical shaped Pudding Molds tinned from Inside.  
  Fig.  151 is a copper mold, tinned inside and outside, the double bottom is removable and is kept at an even distance from the edges and bottom by three catches fastened to it.

  WHIPS OR WHISKS USED FOR KITCHEN AND CONFECTIONERY (Fouets de Cuisine et de p&#226;tisserie).  Whips or whisks are made of wicker or tinned wire, several of them should be kept on hand as they are frequently used. The wicker ones are the best, especially for beating creams, but for whipping hot liquids, such as consomm&#233;, sweet or meat jellies, the wire ones are preferable. When beating the white of eggs be careful to observe that the tin on the whisks is partly worn off, for the contact of egg-white with new tin causes it to curdle (Fig. 154). Some use whisks made of untinned brass wire, the wire not being as heavy as the other. 
  FIG. 154.  An illustration of an egg-whisk .  
 
  KITCHEN KNIVES, CLEAVER, CAN-OPENER (Couteaux de Cuisine, Couperet, Ouvre-bo&#238;te).  Have one large, strong knife for chops, one large carving knife for cooked meats, one smaller one for the same purpose and one kitchen knife. It is always advisable to keep a few well sharpened ones in reserve, either for carving or any other unforeseen occasion. Besides these there must be a channeled knife for turning vegetables and fruits. A knife for peeling and also a can-opener; it is most necessary to have a large and strong cleaver for splitting bones, also to be used instead of a mallet for beating meats to flatten them according to one's wants (Figs. 155 to 162).

These pockets are made of unbleached duck; they are used for laying out meringues, choux, or else quenelle forcemeat; they are of the greatest utility in kitchen and pastry work and it is advisable to have them of graduated sizes. The sockets are movable and are fitted in the bottom of the pocket before filling them. 
  FIG. 179, FIG. 180, FIG. 181.  An illustration of a Jelly Bag and Two Graduated Pastry pockets of Different Sizes.  
  Fig.  180 shows us the graduated different sizes reduced to the tenth of their proper dimensions; these are the ones most generally used for kitchen work and pastry.   Fig.  181 is half the natural size and represents a section of a series of sockets the most used for all work.  
 
  SOUFFL&#201; PAN, AND PIE DISH(Casserole &#224; Souffl&#233;, et Plat &#224; Tarte).   These vessels are of plated ware or sterling silver, made in different shapes and different sizes; they are indispensable in a kitchen and are used principally for cooking souffl&#233;s, but they can also be used for baking purposes, for poaching creams by bain marie and in fact for serving vegetables or garnishings on the table (Fig. 182). 
   FIG. 182, FIG. 183.  An illustration of One Round and One Tectangular Pie Dishes.  
  Pie Dish. -Made of English china that can be placed in the oven without any danger of cracking; they are most useful. In these dishes one can cook  meat,   chicken,   game  or  fish  pies,  fruit  pies, or puddings, or creams, also can be used for souffl&#233;s. There is no end to their utility in a kitchen and there should always be plenty of different sizes. What makes them more useful and convenient is that they can very well be placed on the table with their contents as they were taken from the oven; for instance, anything baked, creams, puddings, etc. ( Fig.  183).  
  KITCHEN BRUSHES (Pinceaux de Cuisine).  Brushes will be found very useful in a kitchen; it is better to have several; they can be made by any one; merely tying turkeys' tail feathers firmly together. Take the feathers, one by one, remove the feathers on each side, leaving only the end, then put about fifteen of these together, tie with rows of strings, beginning on the feathered end and girding tightly; fasten at the other or upper end, tying the string firmly; now cut the lower end to equalize the quills; they do not last very long. Brushes can be purchased made of hair with a tin handle, much neater, stronger and easier to keep clean; these are shown in the Figs. 184 and 184a. 
   FIG. 184, FIG. 184a.  An illustration of Two Kitchen Brushes of Different Sizes.  
 
  OMELET, AND OYSTER STEW PAN (Po&#234;le &#224; Omelette, et Casserole pour les Hu&#238;tres).    Omelet Pan. -A black, iron pan, polished on the inside. These pans are used principally for omelets; they should never be washed; when coated or burned on the inside, scrape with a flexible knife all that sticks to the bottom, heat well and then rub with a cloth and some salt until perfectly clean. The French omelet pans are the best, both for shape and strength (Fig. 185). 
   FIG. 185, FIG. 186.  An illustration of an Omelet Pan and a Stew pan made up of Iron and Copper Respectively.  
   Oyster  Stew Pan.  -This saucepan is made of various sizes in tin with a copper bottom. It is furnished with a rounded cover perforated in the center with several small holes. The handle is very long. This saucepan is used for  oysters  and their liquor placed on the hot fire and when the steam escapes through the holes then remove it at once ( Fig.  186).   
  SPOONS (Cuill&#232;res).  Fig. 187, represents four spoons, soup or table, dessert, tea and coffee.  The approximative liquid capacity is; six soup or tablespoonfuls of liquid make a gill or forty-eight a quart.  Twelve dessertspoonfuls of liquid for a gill; eighteen teaspoonfuls and thirty-six coffeespoonfuls. For sugar it requires eight tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar for a pound, sixteen dessertspoonfuls, twenty-four teaspoonfuls and forty-eight coffeespoonfuls. For flour it takes ten tablespoonfuls for a pound, twenty dessertspoonfuls, thirty teaspoonfuls and sixty coffeespoonfuls. 
   FIG. 187.  An illustration of of a Coffee, Tea, Dessert and Soup Spoon; compared for their liquid capacities by being placed on top of each other.  
 
  WEIGHTS AND MEASURES (Piods et Measures).  Various ways of obtaining weights and measure.   Weight by Quarts.  -One quart of water weighs two pounds and four ounces; one quart of milk two pounds and an ounce and a half; cream two pounds and one ounce; oil one pound and fourteen ounces; melted butter the same weight as oil; powdered sugar one pound nine ounces; rice one pound three ounces; flour one pound two ounces; bread-crumbs eleven ounces; horseradish or cocoanut twelve ounces; wheaten grits or Indian meal fifteen ounces; oatmeal thirteen ounces; semolina one pound seven ounces.   Weight by Handfuls.  -A handful of sugar weighs six ounces; flour four ounces; bread-crumbs two ounces; rice three ounces; herbs, parsley, etc., one ounce.   Weight by Coffeecups.  -Six cupfuls of sugar weigh one pound; nine of flour one pound; eight of Indian meal, one pound; six of rice one pound. Ten black coffeecupfuls of water make one quart. Six teacupfuls of water make one quart. Four breakfast cupfuls of water make one quart.  
  REFRIGERATOR, ICE-BOX AND COLD ROOM(R&#233;frig&#233;rateur, Glaci&#232;re Timbre, et Chambre froide).   These refrigerators are to be kept full of ice so to reduce the temperature inwardly and to avoid inconvenience arising from the excessive heat of the atmosphere. A refrigerator as shown in the accompanying design is all that is necessary for a restaurant, etc. At a third of its height are placed wooden gratings to uphold the ice, underneath is to be found a sheet of zinc or galvanized sheet iron with a small gutter, at the end, between this and the sheet of iron is a space of six inches. The bottom parts of these ice-boxes are used for keeping either beef palates,
   FIG. 188.  An illustration of an Old but Large Refrigerator, consisting of a number of Storage portions for Different Purposes.  
   calf 's  heads,   sheep's  trotters, croquette preparations of all kinds, etc.; each compartment should be entirely separate from one another, having a special one for  fish,  one for poultry, one for  game,  one for  cold meats,  one for garnishings, etc.   The Ice box  is simply a box of an oblong shape sufficiently thick to be filled with a non-conducting material such as  charcoal,  sawdust, tow, or simply an hermetically empty space not to allow the air to pass through the box; they are lined inside with galvanized sheet iron or zinc.   The cold room  is of a more modern invention, the  meats  being hung up in the inside. Cooked  meats,  also different provisions requiring a cold temperature of forty-five to fifty degrees Fahrenheit, such as  butter,   milk  or  cream,  rest on shelves or in drawers, without being in direct contact with the ice, for it is evident that the cold air surrounding these provisions do not contain the slightest moisture that might destroy their properties. Another advantage the cold room has is that a quantity of cold entr&#233;es or sweet dishes already decorated with the  jellies  that are to be served will keep in perfect condition for a few days, while those placed directly on the ice do not afford the same security; however, each one has its own peculiar advantages and one must not be sacrificed for the other, on the contrary in all large kitchens each one has its own place and have both become indispensable.  
  MEAT-SAFE (Garde-Manger).  This is a kind of round or square cage composed of metallic cloth on a framework of iron or wood, provided inside with several shelves; also hanging hooks to which can be hung meats, poultry and game. On the shelves are placed all the provisions that should be exposed to the air without incurring any danger of contact with flies. These meat-safes are either suspended from the ceiling of the pantry by a pulley or else fastened to the wall outside a window; in both cases in order to have them accomplish their purpose they must be exposed to a thorough draught of air in as cool a place as possible. If the meat safe is hung in a room it can be entirely open on top, if on the contrary it is fastened outside then the upper part must certainly have a slightly inclining roof so that no rain can penetrate the inside. These meat-safes are only useful where ice is scarce for ice-boxes, are far preferable under all circumstances.

  BILL OF FARE HOLDER (Porte-Menu).  The bill of fare is the programme of the dinner on which is found inscribed the dishes composing the meal. For ceremonious dinners the bills of fare are printed or else written on rich paper. They are laid on the table or fastened in a holder such as shown in Fig. 197; they are to be made either of silver or silver plate; if the bills of fare are printed, they are then usually laid between two guests. 
  FIG. 197.  An illustration of a Bill of Fare Written on a Rich Stylish Paper carved with Beautiful Flowery Designs.  
 
  COVERS FOR ROUND AND LONG DISHES (Cloches pour Plats Ronds et Longs).  Those for the kitchen are made of tin and are used to cover the dishes after they are dressed, either to keep them in the hot closet or to carry to the dining-room; have always round and long ones for both large and small dishes. These require to be kept very clean and bright.  
 
   SOUPS (Potages). 
  An illustration of Two Soup Dishes and a Number of Dinner Plates Nicely arranged on the a Dinner Table.  
 Soup is the prelude of the dinner; it is a healthy, light and stimulating food, agreeing with every one, especially children and old people. The basis of soup is  broth,  and therefore it is on this article that one's whole attention must be borne. There are two kinds of soup,  fat  and lean; they are divided into clear and thick; the garnishings for these soups are either composed of crusts, vegetables, creams of  game  or poultry,  eggs,   fish,  quenelles, timbales, chiffonades, finely minced  herbs,  crustacean,  farina ceous, etc. These two kinds of soups are divided into six chapters: First, Bisques; second, Consomm&#233; and Garnishings; third, Creams; fourth, Cosmopolitan or Mixed; fifth,  Fish;  sixth, Pur&#233;es. Pur&#233;es may be made into creams by using less  butter  and adding instead  cream  and  egg-yolks,  while creams can be turned into pur&#233;es by suppressing the  cream  and  egg-yolks,  and stirring in, when ready to serve, a piece of fresh, fine  butter.  
  
  (184). FAT  (La Graisse). 
 Fat  is insoluble in  water,  but melts by heat and floats on the surface of a liquid. As it is enveloped in the cells of a very fine indissoluble membrane, one part of the  fat  adheres always to the fibers, unless the cooking be too long and the cells are broken by the force of the boiling.  Fat  exists either separately in certain parts of animals, and in other parts it is interposed between the fibers; these last parts are always the most digestible and the most nourishing.   Albumen (L'Albumine).  -Is of the same nature as the  white of egg  which contains scarcely anything else than albumen; it is soluble in cold or tepid  water  and coagulates between one hundred and fifty to two hundred and ten degrees Fahrenheit. Albumen abounds in the blood and it is found in every part of the flesh; it coagulates after being dissolved, and in  broth  forms what is called scum, rising to the surface of liquids in which  meats  are cooked. The less blood the animal has lost, the more there is albumen, and as the blood contains much osmazome, the result will be that  meat  having the most blood will produce a more  savory  soup than that which has lost a larger quantity.  When a piece of either  beef  or  mutton  is needed rare, it must be plunged into boiling liquid, and being at once seized by the action of the heat, the albumen coagulates and encloses the osmazome inside. Allow fifteen minutes for each pound of  meat  for a  leg of mutton  weighing six to eight pounds; if boiled according to this time the  meat  will be found rare, unless the boiling has been  too long. If on the contrary, this same piece of  meat  be put into  cold water  and is allowed to cook slowly, the albumen not coagulating at once, will let the osmazome escape into the liquid and the  meats  will be  white  and less juicy, but as nothing is lost, the  broth  will have gained by it in quality.    Bones  (Les os).  -Are inorganic parts having much solidity besides being of a gelatineous nature; they contain considerable  fat  substance analogous to  marrow,  but this is but a part of their matter.  Bones  contain eight times more  gelatin  than  meat.  They are generally split into smaller pieces.  
  
  (185). FIBRINE  (La Fibrine). 
 Fibrine  is insoluble; it forms the base of the muscles or flesh. After  meat  has been very much cooked, after it has boiled a long time, the remainder of it is almost pure fibrine. Fibrine is not very nutritious, and when it has thoroughly exhausted its soluble qualities, it becomes difficult to digest. Pure fibrine has no savor, it is insipid or flavorless and becomes yellow and brittle after drying.    Gelatin  (La G&#233;latine).  - Gelatin  is soluble in very hot or  boiling water,  in tepid  water  it swells and dissolves only partially, and in  cold water  it softens without dissolving. It is colorless, insipid, inodorous and is susceptible to pass rapidly into a state of acetic fermentation. There is very little nutrition in  gelatin;  when in sufficient quantity it gives the  broth  the peculiar quality of forming into a  jelly  when cold.  Gelatin  exists in all parts of the  meat,  but more profusely in gristle and  bone.  In a pure state it is insipid.   Osmazome (L'Osmaz&#244;me).  -Soluble even when cold, this is a part of the flesh of the  beef,  of the  brain  and of certain  mushrooms.  It is osmazome which gives to the  broth  its savor, its aroma and its sapidity. It is supplied with an exceedingly stimulating property, exciting the appetite and helping considerably to facilitate digestion; it seems to exist only in the flesh and blood, and more abundantly in old cattle and in dark  meats,  than in young animals and  white meat.  The properties of osmazome are more perceptible when the  meats  are broiled or roasted; then the sapidity is stronger and the aroma more exhilarating. Poultry gives very little sapidity to broths unless they be old and very  fat,  for their  grease  has a more pronounced flavor than that found in quadrupeds. Gristle,  fat  and  bones  are entirely free of osmazome; in broths there is one part osmazome to seven parts  gelatin.   
  
  (186). CARE TO BE TAKEN WHILE PREPARING BROTH  (Des Soins &#224; Prendre pour Pr&#233;parer le Bouillon). 
 First.  -Select the freshest  meats  procurable; do not wash, but remove all that is not of the very freshest;  bone  and tie up each piece separately leaving them as large as possible; split the  bones  and put them into a soup-pot with  cold water  and the  meat.    Second.  -Heat and boil it up slowly to give the albumen time to dissolve in the liquid; it coagulates so soon as the liquid reaches one hundred and fifty degrees Fahrenheit, and rising to the surface brings with it all the impurities contained therein, which is called scum.   Third.  -Carefully remove this scum as quickly as it rises to the surface, and before the liquid boils, for after that the scum partly dissolves and the rest of it precipitates and destroys the transparency of the  broth.  When the  broth  is well skimmed, add  salt,   allspice,  and vegetables; then keep it boiling as continuously and slowly as possible to prevent too much evaporation.  
  
  (187). CLEAR BOUILLON  (Bouillon Clair). 
There is nothing that resembles consomm&#233; more than clarified bouillon, and if it does not entirely take its place as regards quality, still it is often used instead. Clarified bouillon is in reality only an imitation of consomm&#233;, it is equally true that with care it can easily be prepared in excellent conditions, the principal one being to operate with good bouillon, either of  chicken,   beef  or  game,  etc. To obtain clear bouillon, only  lean meats  must be used for clarification; in order to obtain four quarts of bouillon, have one pound of  lean beef  free of all  fat  and nerves, chop it finely, and mix in with it, two  raw eggs  and one pint of cold bouillon; place the strained bouillon on the fire, skimmed free of all its  fat,  and when it reaches boiling point, pour into it the clarification, beating it well with a  whip.  As soon as the bouillon boils, keep it to the same degree of heat without allowing it to boil, for one hour; skim the  fat  off, season with  salt  and a little   sugar,  and color it with  caramel  (No. 18), then remove and strain through a wet napkin stretched and fastened to the four  legs  of a kitchen stool ( Fig.  99), or else a silk sieve. These bouillons are to be served with garnishings of Italian pastes and  farina s, also garnishings of vegetables, etc., for various soups.  
  
  (188). WHITE CHICKEN BOUILLON OR BROTH  (Bouillon Blanc de Volaille). 
Have ten quarts of  water  in a soup pot; add to it three pounds of  knuckle of veal,  and trimmings, seven pounds of very fresh poultry. Boil, skim, and put in three quarters of a pound of  carrots,  half a pound of  turnips,  twelve ounces of  leeks,  two  onions,  one stuck with two  cloves,  two ounces of  celery,  one ounce of  parsley roots,  two  bay leaves,   salt,  sixty grains of whole  peppers;  boil slowly and continuously for four hours, then strain through a silk sieve. If needed in a great hurry, boil six quarts of ordinary  stock,  have two  fowls  of three pounds each, after removing the  breasts,  chop the remainder of the  fowls  coarsely, put them in the  stock,  add four ounces of minced  carrots  and six ounces of  leeks  also minced, boil slowly for one hour; skim off the  fat,  season with  salt,  strain through a fine sieve or moistened napkin, and serve. The  breasts  are used for  forcemeat  or to clarify  broth.   
  
  (189). CLARIFIED CONSOMM&#201; AND REMOISTENING. (Consomm&#233; Clarifi&#233; et Remouillage). 
 Proportions.  -When the  stock   (No. 194a)  is ready put five quarts of it into a soup pot, adding two pounds of  lean meat  and three pounds of cleansed and washed  fowls.  Boil it up slowly, and just when ready to come to a boil, carefully remove the scum arising on the surface and then add half a pound of roasted  veal.  Simmer slowly until the  fowl  is cooked, which will take from two and a half to three hours, lifting it out as soon as it is done so as to save the  breasts  which will be found useful for garnishings, pur&#233;es, salads, sandwiches, etc.; return what remains of the  fowls  to the  broth  once again and continue boiling for half an hour longer, skim the  fat  off very carefully and mix in the clarification.   Clarification.  -Trim off the  fat,  remove the nerves from a piece of  beef  sufficient to obtain two pounds after it is chopped up, and mix in with this chopped  meat  half a quart of  cold stock  (or  water ); pour this clarification into the  broth,  add two ounces of minced  carrots,  and two ounces of minced  leeks;  season with  salt  and color the soup with  caramel   (No. 18) ; keep the liquid in a boiling state for one hour. The consomm&#233; should be perfectly clear, sapid and tasty: strain it through a silk sieve or a fine napkin and use when needed, serve in cups, or in a soup tureen with any garnishing desired.   Remoistening.  -After the  stock  or consomm&#233; has been taken out of the pot, pour in sufficient  water  to have the  meats  entirely re-covered and boil again for three hours; remove all the  fat  and strain it through a napkin; do not  salt  this. This remoistening is used for diluting certain soups, and to moisten  veal  or  chicken stock  with which  meat extract  is made  (see meat extract, No. 368) .  
  
  (190). CLARIFIED CHICKEN CONSOM&#201;,  (Consomm&#233; de Volaille Clarifi&#233;). 
Put into a soup pot eight quarts of  white chicken broth   (No. 188) , add two pounds of  knuckle of veal,  one pound of  chicken legs  and pinions, then boil, skim, and put in four pounds of roasted, unbrowned  chicken,  two minced  leeks,  one medium sized minced  carrot,  one  onion  stuck with one  clove,  a little  parsley  and  celery roots.  Boil continually for four hours. Chop up very fine two pounds of  veal,  mix in with it two whole  eggs,  dilute with one quart of  cold broth  and stir this into the consomm&#233;, using a  whip,  adding two broken up  chicken  carcasses. Boil on a slow fire for one hour,  salt  it according to taste, and strain it through a silk sieve.  
  
  (191). CLARIFIED FISH CONSOMM&#201;,  (Consomm&#233; de Poisson Clarifi&#233;). 
 Butter  the bottom of a saucepan, garnishing it with sliced  onions,  and place on top six pounds of  fish bones,  such as  bass,   perch  or any other gelatinous  fish,  a bunch of  celery,   parsley,   bay leaf,   thyme,  one pound of minced  carrots,  a pound and a half of  leeks,  and dilute with one quart of  water.  Cover the saucepan, set it over a slow fire, and let fall to a colorless glaze, then moisten with four quarts of  hot water,  boil, skim and let simmer for one hour, then strain through a sieve, and clarify the  broth  with the  whites of four eggs  and half a bottleful of  white wine.   
 
  
  (192). CLARIFIED GAME CONSOMM&#201;  (Consomm&#233; Brun de Gibier Clarifi&#233;). 
 Butter  the inside of a very thick saucepan, cover the bottom with sliced  onions,  and lay on top three pounds of broken  knuckle of veal  and eight pounds of  game,  such as  partridges,   quails,   pheasants  and young  rabbit,  also half a pound of  legs  and pinions or bits of poultry, moisten with a pint of  stock,  place it on a moderate fire, and cover the saucepan; let steam and fall to a glaze, then dilute with half bottle of  white wine,  and ten quarts of  stock  or  water.  Boil, then skim and season with  salt  and two  pepper corns  for each quart of liquid, two  cloves,  also half a pound of  carrots,  one ounce of  parsley roots,  half a pound of  leeks,  two ounces of  celery,  the whole minced. Remove all the  bones  from two very fresh young  rabbits;  put these in with the  stock  and boil all for four hours; strain through a sieve and put it back into the saucepan; chop up fine the flesh from the  rabbits  with as much  lean beef meat,  mix in with it two whole  eggs  and dilute with half a bottleful of  white wine.  Skim off all the  fat  from the  broth  and stir in the chopped  rabbits,  continuing stirring for one minute, then let come to a boil, move it from the hot fire, and boil slowly and unceasingly for one half hour more; after the consomm&#233; is very clear, strain it through a silk sieve or through a napkin.  
  
  (193). CLARIFIED LENT VEGETABLE CONSOMM&#201; (Consomm&#233; maigre de L&#233;gumes Clarifi&#233;). 
Mince about three pounds of  carrots  and three pounds of  turnips,  one pound of the  white of celery,  one pound of  onions,  half a pound of  parsley roots,  a quarter of a pound of  parsnips  and a pound and a half of  leeks.  Put half a pound of  butter  into a saucepan, warm it and fry the vegetables, then moisten with two quarts of  water  and reduce slowly until they fall into a glaze. Dilute it with ten quarts of  water,  season with  salt,   pepper,  half an ounce of  sugar  and  cloves,  adding one pound of  mushroom  stalks, then boil slowly until the vegetables are well done without mashing, and strain through a sieve. Return it to the fire and clarify the  broth  with the  whites of four eggs  and half a bottle of  white wine.  After it is very clear, strain it through a silk sieve or a napkin.  
  
  (194a). BEEF STOCK OR BROTH  (Grand Bouillon de B&#x153;uf). 
 Proportion of Ingredients.  -Ten quarts of  water,  a quarter of a pound of  chicken legs,  one and one quarter ounces of  salt,  six ounces of  leeks,  half ounce of soup  celery,  eight pounds of  meat  with  bone,  twenty grains or  cloves of black pepper,  six ounces of  carrots,  one half ounce of  parsnip,  one half  clove of garlic  (if desired), two whole  cloves,  three ounces  turnips,  four ounces of  onions,  one of which stuck with two  cloves.   Put ten quarts of  water  into a stockpot, add eight pounds of  beef meat  (trimmings and  bone ), let there be at least two-thirds  meat,  being careful to have both  meat  and trimmings well freed of  fat;  and a quarter of a pound of scalded  chicken legs,  after removing the outer  skin.  Heat this up slowly so that it comes gradually to a boil, then skim carefully and add twenty grains of whole  black peppers  and one and one quarter ounces of  salt.  Put into a net six ounces of  carrots,  three ounces of  turnips,  six ounces of  leeks,  half an ounce of  parsnips,  one half an ounce of soup  celery,  and two ounces of  onions  in which two  cloves  should be stuck. Close the net and set it in the pot; after the vegetables have cooked for two hours, remove the net containing the vegetables and continue boiling the soup for two hours longer, making four hours in all. Take off all the  fat  from the surface and strain the soup either through a silk tammy or a napkin; pour it into another pot to make consomm&#233;; and in case it should be needed the following day only, pour it into vessels and set it to cool; the following is an economical way of doing so: set the vessels in a  water  reservoir supplied continually with  cold water  from melting ice in the refrigerators and brought through a pipe in the bottom of the tank, have a larger overflow pipe placed near the top so as to allow the  water  as it heats to flow off.  
  
  (194b). PARTS OF BEEF USED FOR PREPARING BOUILLONS AND STOCKS,  SEE FIG. 302  (Parties du B&#x153;uf Servant &#224; Faire les Bouillons et les Fonds, Voir Fig. 302). 
These various pieces are No. 2, the cheek jowl; No. 3, the  neck;  No. 4, the brisket; No. 5, the cross- ribs;  No. 6, the shin; No. 8, the plate; No. 9, the navel; No. 10, the inside flank; No. 11, the thick flank; No. 17, the round bottom; No. 18, the  leg.  The shin is the bottom part of the hind quarter the nearest to the ankle  bone.  The gelatinous flesh of the shin renders it suitable for the preparation of  stock,  broths and  jellies.   
 
  
  (195). GAME, VEGETABLE, FISH AND CHICKEN STOCK, FOR THICK SOUPS  (Fonds de Gibier, L&#233;gumes, Poisson et Volaille pour Potages Lies). 
In order to make thick  stock  use consomm&#233; of  game,  vegetables,  fish  or  chicken  before they are clarified. Place half a pound of  butter  in a saucepan with half a pound of sifted  flour  of the best quality, let cook well on a slow fire without coloring when needed for vegetables,  fish  or  chicken,  but for  game  make a brown roux; for either one or the other dilute this roux with boiling  broth  (if the soup should be a  chicken  soup,  chicken broth  should be used to dilute the roux, if  game  soup then  game broth  should be used,  fish  with  fish broth,  for vegetable, vegetable  broth ). Use a whisk turning it rapidly, so as to avoid having lumps; stocks for soups should be kept rather thin, that is to say but little thickened and should be well despumated, the  fat  removed before passing through the tammy; return the saucepan to the fire, and stir continuously with a spatula from the bottom until the  broth  boils. Remove the saucepan and place it so that only one side of the contents cook slowly for one hour; skim and take off all the matter that swims on the surface until the  stock  be entirely free from  fat,  and other impurities floating on top arising from the clarification, then strain through a tammy or fine sieve, and use this  stock  for thick soups either of  game,  vegetables,  fish  or poultry.  
  
  (196). BISQUES  (Bisques). 
An exquisite and delicious bisque. The ancient bisques made between the years 1700 to 1750, differed greatly from our modern bisques. They were more like stews than soups or potages and were prepared with  squabs,   quails,  pullets and  fish,  the  crawfish  only serving as a garnish, and were basted over with a  crawfish gravy.  Bisques as they are made to-day, are simply a pur&#233;e, thickened with  rice,  or thick  stock,  or wet crusts and accompanied by various garnishings. Bisques are divided into five classes: First, those made of  clams,   oysters  or  mussels;  Second,  crabs;  Third, shrimps, Fourth,  crawfish;  Fifth,  lobsters.

  (245). CREAM SOUPS  (Potages Cr&#232;me). 
I believe it to be more advisable to select fresh vegetables for making  cream  soups, and to thicken them with  raw egg yolks,   butter  and  cream.  The flavor of the fresh vegetables combined with the velvety liaison, helps to make these thick soups highly estimated, even were the  cream  and  eggs  to be suppressed. Pur&#233;es can be made of these creams, finishing by them as indicated in the pur&#233;e soups. For Lenten  cream  soups, moisten them with a vegetable  stock  instead of  broth,  and use lean b&#233;chamel, in the place of velout&#233;.  Cream  soups will be improved by passing them through a tammy.

This glaze should be very clear; suppress the bottom, and use it in sauces etc., or else add it to the spanish  sauce  stocks.  
  
  (402). MEAT GLAZE, PLAIN  (Glace de Viande Simple). 
 To Prepare  Meat  Glaze.  -In the every day work of a kitchen, the  meat  glaze is always prepared either with the superfluous stocks or remoistening broths; it is a very easy matter to accomplish this. Skim off the  fat  from all surplus stocks, and then strain them; should they be troubled, clarify with a little  lean beef  operating the  sauce  as for consomm&#233;. After the liquid is once strained, set it into one or several saucepans, pouring it off steadily from the sediment, and reduce the liquid quickly, while stirring it in the saucepan with a ladle, until it becomes slightly thick; now pour it into a smaller saucepan, and leave it to boil on one side of the fire, while skimming, until the glaze is quite thick, then pour it into cans and let it get cold in a cool place to use when needed.

  (413). HALF-GLAZE SAUCE, THICKENED  (Sauce demi-glace li&#233;e). 
A half glaze  sauce  only differs from an espagnole by its lightness. This  sauce  is generally made in large quantities at the time, so as not to begin it so frequently, as it requires the utmost care in its preparation. Heat in a saucepan one pound of  clarified butter,  and when it is very hot fill it up with  flour  so as to obtain a  paste  rather too light than otherwise; thicken it well while stirring for a few minutes on the fire, and then set it aside in a warm part to cook and brown very slowly, without adhering to the bottom of the pan, and without letting it get black. Five or six hours after, pour it into a vessel, cover it with  paper,  and let this roux stand to get cool.   To make the  Sauce :  dilute the roux very slowly, with some  beef stock  (No. 194a), having it only slightly warm, and prepared for this purpose, and finish it exactly like the espagnole; it must be as clear as possible and of a light color; strain and skim it well. Stir the liquid over the fire to thicken the  sauce,  managing not to have any lumps in it, and should it not be perfectly smooth, then strain it through a fine colander Put four ounces of  butter  in a saucepan, add to it four ounces each of  sliced  carrots,   onions  and  celery root;  the same quantity of  lean ham  cut in quarter inch squares, a bunch of  parsley  garnished with  bay leaves,   thyme  and  allspice,  fry without coloring, pour the  sauce  over the whole, add four gills of good  white,  dry  wine,  and a quarter of a pound of  mushroom  parings, and let all boil while stirring, then remove it at once to the side of the range, and continue boiling on one side only, so as to be able to despumate it properly for several hours. Strain and put as much of this as is needed into a reducing saucepan with two gills of  meat  glaze  (No. 401) ; boil, reduce it to the necessary degree, using a spatula to stir it from the bottom, without leaving it for one instant, incorporate slowly into it a little good  veal  blond  (No. 423)  and a small quantity of good  white wine.  When the  sauce  is succulent without being too thick, strain it through a tammy and pour it into a vessel, or else into a saucepan to keep warm in a bain-marie.   Clear Half-Glaze Thickened.  -Have a quart of well-reduced clear  stock   (No. 404) ; put it on the fire to boil, add six tablespoonfuls and skim it carefully, adding two tablespoonfuls of fecula,  arrowroot,  or  cornstarch,  diluted in a little  cold water,  pouring it slowly into the  stock  while stirring it with a  whip;  boil again, skim and strain through a fine sieve; set it in a bain-marie and cover the top with some  Madeira wine.   
  
  (414). BROWN, ESPAGNOLE OR SPANISH SAUCE  (Sauce Brune Espagnole). 
Espagnole or Spanish  sauce  is a leading  sauce  from which many smaller ones are made. To obtain a good espagnole, it is necessary to have good  stock   (No. 421) ; in case there be no  stock  specially prepared for this purpose, use good clear  broth.  For four quarts of  stock,  melt in a saucepan one pound of  butter,  stir into it the same weight of very dry, good  flour,  so as to obtain a clear  paste;  then let it cook for four or five minutes on the fire, without ceasing to stir, and afterward set it back on to a very slow fire, or in a slack oven, to let it get a good dark brown color, being careful to move it about often. When the roux is cooked, take it from the oven and dilute with the prepared  stock,  not having it too hot, and stir the liquid again over the fire to bring it to a boil. Should the  sauce  not be sufficiently smooth -should any lumps appear in it, then strain it through a fine sieve, and put it back into the saucepan; and at the first boil, set it on one side so that it only boils partially, and let it despumate in this way for two or three hours. Skim off well the  fat,  and strain the  broth  into a vessel to let get cold, meanwhile stirring frequently.  
  
  (415). VELOUT&#201; SAUCE  (Sauce Velout&#233;e). 
The velout&#233; like the espagnole is also a leading  sauce  used for making secondary sauces. Melt three-fourths of a pound of  butter  in a small saucepan; stir into it three-fourths of a pound of good  flour,  and let the roux cook for a few minutes, then set the saucepan on a slower fire without letting it color; in order to obtain a well thickened  sauce,  the  flour  must be well cooked. When the roux is sufficiently done dilute it gradually with four quarts of good  stock   (No. 423) . In case there be no special  stock  prepared for this  sauce  then use some good clear  chicken stock   (No. 195) . Stir the liquid over the fire until it comes to a boil, then move it aside to let it cook on one side only; despumate the  sauce  for one hour, skimming off all the  white  particles arising to the surface; remove all the  fat,  and strain the velout&#233; through a sieve into a vessel and let it get cool while lifting off the scum that forms on the top.  
  
  (416). VELOUT&#201; AND BROWN, ESPAGNOLE OR SPANISH SAUCE FOR LEAN  (Sauce Velout&#233;e et Espagnole en Mai

Rice,   Indian  Style , is served likewise as a garnishing for  chicken  or  veal,  and is prepared with  fine Indian rice,  its grains being long,  white  and whole; in case none of this can be procured, then take Carolina  rice.  Plunge it into a bountiful supply of  boiling water  after picking and washing it, and as soon as it no longer cracks between the teeth, then drain it through a colander, and wash it off with salted tepid  water,  spread it over a large sieve, cover with a cloth, and leave it to dry for a few moments at the oven door, then dress it in a vegetable dish, cover and serve.

  (959). TIMBALES, REMARKS ON  (Observations sur les Timbales). 
There are several kinds of timbales; those made with a very thin timbale  paste;  those of quenelle  forcemeat  and those of  cream forcemeat,  either of  chicken,   game  or  fish.  The name timbale should only be applied to those made of  paste  cylindrical-shaped like a footless goblet, or a silver mug, or else half spherical-shaped in imitation of the kettle- drum  used in an orchestra and filled with a garnishing of some kind. A "bung" would better represent the idea of what is commonly called timbale, and I would suggest the adoption of the French of bung "bondon," for I scarcely believe that the elegance of the bill of fare would be marred by reading: "Bondons of Pickerel &#224; la Walton," or "Bondons of  Chicken  &#224; la Reine," or "Bondons of  Woodcock  &#224; la Diane," or "Bondons of  Pheasants  &#224; la Benois." I have not the slightest intention of changing the conventional name. I only suggest an idea that might be advantageously followed if so desired. For making timbales cylindrical molds (No. 2,  Fig.  137) two and five-eighths inches wide by two and one-eighth inches high are generally used;  butter  the insides with fresh unmelted  butter  and decorate with fanciful cuts of  truffles,   tongue,  pistachios, etc. They may also be strewn with  truffles,   tongue,   lobster coral  and pistachios, all these being chopped up finely and separately, then dried in the air. Fill with  forcemeat  either with or without a salpicon, then poach; for this consult Elementary Methods  (No. 152) . Invert on to a dish containing a little consomm&#233; and serve the  sauce  that accompanies the timbales separately.

Butter  and decorate the molds (No. 2,  Fig.  137) with a large  truffle  ring at the bottom, and a small piece of  truffle  in the center of this; ornament the sides with eight perpendicular thin slices of  truffles  each three-sixteenths of an inch wide, laid at equal distances apart around the mold: cover the bottom and sides with a  game  quenelle  forcemeat   (No. 91) ; in the middle place a half inch in diameter ball of the salpicon, lay over more  forcemeat,  and poach the timbales as in  No. 152.  Serve separately a half-glaze  sauce   (No. 413) , with essence of  game   (No. 389)  and Rhine  wine  added.

  THE QUAHAUG OR LITTLE NECK CLAMS (Lucines Orang&#233;es ou Clovis).  There are many kinds of these bivalves, but these of which we speak are greatly appreciated as an article of food. Small ones an inch to an inch and three-quarters in diameter are served raw, in the months of May, June, July and August, entirely replacing the oyster. Little neck clams are the most remarkable of their kind, their principal characteristic being the uniting to the hinge of cardinal and lateral teeth; beside these they possess three other teeth, two being diverging. They are far preferable to the large clams for all culinary preparations, being more tender, of a finer flavor and their taste less strong than the others.

  OYSTERS (Huitres).  A bivalve having an irregular shell attached by hinges, and having an oblong, grooved indent across. It is headless, toothless and sexless; it cannot live out of water, and is specially fond of the mouths of rivers. The fishing begins in September, and finishes in the latter part of April; in all the intervening months, or those containing no letter R in their names, the oysters are replaced by Little Neck clams. Fresh oysters are easier digested in the raw state than when cooked, for the heat hardens them while the sea water in the raw ones facilitates digestion. Oysters contain plenty of water, very little solid animal matter, a great deal of lime and sulphate of iron, osmazome and gelatin. These bivalves agree with worn-out constitutions, but should be eaten very fresh. Like certain fishes, oysters contain phosphorus.

   TERRAPIN (Terrap&#232;ne).  Diamond-back or salt water terrapin are found all along the Atlantic coast, but more especially in the Chesapeake bay and its tributaries; other salt water species from Massachusetts to Texas are quite numerous, and as a substitute for those of the Chesapeake are extensively used by houses of ordinary reputation. The scarcity of Chesapeake diamond-back terrapin grows more apparent each year, and even now it frequently requires many days of laborious and tedious work and many miles of walking over soft boggy marshes, of prodding in deep narrow channels with long shafted tongs by men skilled and familiar with all their cunnings habits before one is taken from a hiding place, just below the surface, sufficiently deep for protection against the winter frosts. The favorite place for the hibernation of the very largest size is a few inches below the soft oozy mud at the bed of a three or four fathom V-shaped channel in the bed of a creek of about the same distance from shore to shore. Thousands of such creeks penetrate the shores and islands of the Chesapeake, and those less frequented by man are instinctively selected by the terrapin for its haunts. At least ninety per cent. of those taken from the beds of deep creeks will measure six and one-half to eight and one-half inches with an average weight of nearly two and three-fourths pounds, are females; while eighty per cent. of those bedded in the marshes have an average weight of three-fourths of a pound and measure less than five inches. The males invariably bed in the marshes and among the rushes of very shallow ponds, only venturing in cold water during the summer and the warmest spring and fall months, in which time they lead a migratory life in search of food, consisting principally of small shell fish and the soft-shell crabs. About ninety-eight per cent. of the male terrapin never exceed five inches in length on the bottom shell, while the female has been known to measure nine inches and weigh seven and one-half pounds. In the month of December, 1885, Delmonico received from Baltimore a Chesapeake Maryland terrapin measuring eight and three-fourths inches, weighing nine and one-half pounds and containing fifty-six eggs; this must be accepted as one of the finest specimens ever found of the diamond-back Chesapeake bay terrapin. The standard length for those who buy and sell terrapin is six inches; when of this dimension they are called "counts." Both the male and female are very shy and active, swim well and run (though awkwardly) with considerable speed. Prior to about 1870 the salt and brackish waters of the bay literally teemed with this now nearly exterminated and hence valuable reptile; they could be taken by the dozen at a single haul of a long net, but the market value was so small as to render them almost worthless except for local use, and in consequence thousands of large egg terrapin were fed away to swine or cooked for fattening fowls. The people, thoughtless and unprincipled, have robbed themselves by trapping incalculable quantities of terrapin before they had matured sufficeinty for breeding and by digging eggs from beneath the sand shores where they had been deposited by the females to hatch. While the laws enacted by the legislatures of Maryland and Virginia for their protection differ somewhat they are both excellent, and had they been rigidly enforced this spectacle of ultimate extermination would not exist. The time for hibernation usually lasts about six months, beginning with approaching frosty weather in the fall and continuing till the warm spring weather; they bury a few inches deep in the mud and leave, at the spot where they disappear, a mound in the middle of which a hole can be discerned. It is this mound and its hole which first attracts the attention of the fisherman; during this period an enormous quantity of terrapn are caught in their torpid state. They take no nourishment whatever while in this condition. They hatch their young toward the end of June and the beginning of July. The terrapin season is from the month of November to May; they are at their best during December, January, February and March. Very often terrapin are sent to market in October and November, also penned terrapin of the year before. 
  FIG. 280.  An illustration of a Large Terrapin.  
  Penned  Terrapin  . -Are those caught beforehand and kept in an enclosed place; they are fed on  oysters,   crabs  or  fish;  these  terrapin  are never so good as those freshly caught. The small species of  terrapin  are divided into two classes; heifers, the under shell of these never measuring more than five inches in length, and bulls five to five and a half.  Terrapin  begin to hatch their   eggs  at the age of four years; while growing their shell lengthens one inch every year, so their age may be approximately judged by their length, for example; a six-inch  terrapin  is supposed to be six years old.

  FIG. 281.  An illustration of an Instrument with a Scale Printed on One Side and a Handle on the Other Side.  
 The prices quoted above are the actual prices of  terrapins  in New York, Baltimore and Crisfield, and are liable to fluctuate according to the market supply; this can be overcome by diminishing or augmenting the price per pound.  The letters in the four divisions of the table No. 1, refer to sizes of the  terrapins.  A. denotes  terrapins  from five to six inches; B. from six to seven, etc.  To make use of these tables: Weigh the  terrapins  and barrel as received, deduct weight of barrel, grass, etc., which will leave the net weight. Sort the  terrapins  by sizes in differences of a quarter of an inch, using the measure shown in  Fig.  281. Weigh the  terrapins  of each size by  ounces, then find the average weight of each, refer to table No. 2, looking in the first column for the corresponding length, then find in what column their average weight in ounces is found; in this same section will be found their price by the pound; for instance: a seven and three-quarter inch  terrapin  weighing 64 ounces at $2.05 cents a pound will cost $8.20, or one dozen will cost $98.40.

 This list is only for the best Chesapeake Maryland  terrapins.     To Select  Terrapin  . -To buy  terrapin  See Schedules or Tables Nos. 1 and 2. When buying  terrapin  be careful to observe that the extreme tip or muzzle of the  head  is not injured, that the bottom of the  feet  are not worn off, that the  head  is prettily shaped, small thin and pointed, the eyes brilliant and the  feet  small and slender. The superiority of their race is made apparent by their fine appearance. There is no doubt that the diamond-back Chesapeake bay  terrapin  are far better than any other kind found in the markets. Their price is very high, they being sold on an average of the five to six inch ones or over at a $1.25 a pound or $15.00 to $17.00 a dozen; the six to seven inch ones bring $1.50 a pound or $35.00 to $40.00 a dozen; the seven to eight inch ones bring $1.75 a pound or $55.00 to $60.00 a dozen; the eight to nine inches bring $1.90 a pound or $80.00 to $85.00 a dozen. They should be procured before the extreme cold weather sets in to avoid freezing during the trip, for once frost bitten they die easily.   To Keep the  Terrapin  . -In order to keep them properly they must be left in a cold place forty to forty-five degrees Fahrenheit; it should also be clean, well aired, dark and better be too damp than too dry. They must be placed in large or small boxes according to the quantity; range the  terrapin  in the boxes, pressing them down one beside the other so that they cannot possibly move, and between each bed lay damp sea grass. When packed like this they may be kept for several months. Examine the  terrapin  now and then. Should there be any dead ones take them out. They must be handled with care, laid one next to the other, not thrown, as they are very tender and delicate and are liable to die easily, incurring a heavy loss, as a dead  terrapin  is a ruined one and ought to be thrown away at once. No  eggs  are found in  terrapin  of less than six inches long. 
  
  (1082). TO PREPARE AND COOK TERRAPIN  (Pour Pr&#233;parer et Cuire La Terrap&#232;ne). 
Drop the  terrapin  in sufficient tepid  water  to allow it to swim, and leave them thus for half an hour, then change the  water  several times and wash them well. Scald, by plunging them into  boiling water,  and take out as quickly as the  skin  (a small  white skin  on the  head  and  feet ) can be removed with a cloth, put them on to cook in  water  without any  salt  or  seasoning,  or else in a steam vessel leaving them for thirty to forty-five minutes, and lift them out as quickly as they are done. In order to be sure of this, press the  feet meat  between the fingers, and if it yields easily under the pressure, they are ready. Those that cannot be cooked in forty-five minutes are considered of an inferior quality, and those that are not done after one hour (unless they are very large), should be rejected as worthless, for although the  meat  may eventually become tender, it will be stringy and not have the same delicate taste of a good  terrapin.  Let them get cold, cut off the nails, then break the shell on the flat side, on both sides near the upper or top one; detach this shell from the  meats,  empty out all the insides found in this upper shell, suppressing the entrails and  lights,  and carefully removing the  gall  bladder from the  liver,  being very particular not to break it, also cutting away with the tip of a small knife any  gall  spots to be found thereon, then place the  liver  in  cold water.  Remove the  white  inside muscles, as well as the  head  and tail; separate the  legs  at their joints and divide into an inch and a quarter pieces; do not break the  bones,  the  lights,  entrails,  head,  tail, claws,  heart,  muscles and  gall  bladder to be thrown away. Lay the  terrapin  in a saucepan with the  eggs  and  liver  cut in thin slices, season with  salt,   black pepper  and  cayenne,  and cover with sufficient  water  to attain to the heighth of the  terrapin,  then let boil and finish the cooking in a slow oven for twenty to thirty minutes; the  terrapin  is now ready to be used, and can easily be finished by following the recipes found later on. Should it only be required for the next day, place in tin molds or else small China pots, the proportions being at the inside bottom two and three-eighths inches, on top, three inches in diameter, and two and three-eighth inches high. Allow four or six  eggs  to each, fill them up with  terrapin,  about six ounces for each, and finish filling with the  broth;  each mold will contain one portion. When unmolded each one should weigh seven ounces. This quantity will be sufficient for two or three persons for a dinner and for five persons for a buffet.  
  
  (1083). TERRAPIN &#192; LA BALTIMORE  (Terrap&#232;ne &#224; la Baltimore). 
Have one quart of prepared  terrapin  as explained in  No. 1082 ; drain it off. Cook four ounces of  butter  in a saucepan till it becomes  hazelnut  buter  (No. 567) , but watch carefully that it does not blacken; add to it the  terrapin  with some  salt,  freshly  ground black pepper  and a pinch of  cayenne,  fry for few moments, then moisten with the  broth.  Dilute one tablespoonful of fecula,  arrowroot  or  cornstarch  in a little  cold water,  pour it in with the  terrapin,  toss well to thicken nicely, and just when  ready to serve add half a gill of good  sherry wine.  After the  terrapin  has been prepared it is served in chafing dishes kept warm by  water  boiling continuously by means of an  alcohol  lamp, or else in small silver plated saucepans ( Fig.  282) or in China  terrapins  ( Fig.  283), the backs of which are loose and are used as covers; whichever way may be chosen, be most particular that the  terrapin  is always served very hot.

The  sauce  should be thick and served very hot.  
  
  (1087). TERRAPIN, ANCIENT STYLE  (Terrap&#232;ne &#224; l'Ancienne). 
Choose a six and a half inch  terrapin,  scald to remove the  skin,  and wrap it in several sheets of buttered  paper;  put it on a baking sheet and set it into a slow oven; it will take about an hour to cook; unwrap, and break the shell; remove the  meats,  suppress the  gall -bag attached to the  liver,  also any spots found on the same, and cut it up into slices; take away the  head,  tail, claws, and  white  muscles on the four members, and then warm the  terrapin  in a good thick  gravy   (No. 405) , season with  salt,  freshly  ground pepper,   cayenne,   butter,  adding some good  sherry wine.  Serve on a chafing dish.  
  
  (1088). TERRAPIN, MARYLAND CLUB  (Terrap&#232;ne, Maryland Club).

  (1090b). TERRAPIN, EPICUREAN STYLE  (Terrap&#232;ne &#224; la Epicurienne). 
The diamond-back Chesapeake, Maryland  terrapins  are considered the best. They must be freshly caught. Long Island  terrapins  are also much liked by epicures, some averring that they are as fine as the Chesapeake, but this is not a fact, and I do not hesitate to class them according to the following order: First, the Chesapeake, then the Long Island, Virginia, Charleston and Savannah, North Carolina, Florida, Mississippi and Texas, the Gulf, Mobile, etc. Take two  terrapins,  each one of three pounds weight, and prepare them as described in  No. 1082 . Fry in two ounces of  butter,  adding two ounces of  rice flour  well mingled in; moisten with  water  as high as the  terrapin  and let boil until thoroughly cooked,  seasoning  with  salt,   pepper,  and  mace;  add a pint of  cream  and reduce; finish with three  hard-boiled egg-yolks,  pounded and formed into a  paste  with three tablespoonfuls of good  sherry wine.

  TURTLE (Tortue).  An amphibious quadruped, having all its body, except the head, feet, and tail, covered with a very hard shell. It is enclosed in a cuirass composed of two pieces; the one covering the back is called the carapace; this is convex shaped; the vertebra are attached to it. The underneath one is attached to the breast; this is flat and is called the plastron. The choicest and most delicate part of the turtle is that attached to the upper shell. 
  FIG. 254  An illustration of a Side-View of a Turtle.  
 
  
  (1091). TURTLE, HAVANA STYLE  (Tortue &#224; la Havanaise).

Cut the  meats  up into quarter inch squares, as well as the cutaneous parts from the belly. Fry in  butter  four ounces of  onions  cut in squares; sift over some  flour,  and moisten with the  stock;  add the  turtle meat;  stir the preparation until it comes to a boil, season and thicken with  hard boiled egg-yolks  mixed with an equal quantity of  butter,  and press through a fine sieve. Add some  parsley  and finely chopped raw  mushrooms;  then use this stew to fill up the carapace or deep shell; bestrew over with  bread -raspings, besprinkle with  butter  and brown a nice color in a slow oven; serve when very hot.  
  
  (1093). TURTLE STEWED &#192; LA FOSTER  (Rago&#251;t de Tortue &#224; la Foster). 
Cut the  turtle meat  into one inch and a quarter squares; fry them in  butter,  and sprinkle over with  flour,  stir well, then moisten with  broth,  adding a bunch of  parsley  garnished with  thyme  and  bay leaf,  small  onions,  a piece of  bacon  cut into three-sixteenth inch squares, and  mushrooms  cut the same; season with  salt,  black and  red pepper,  this should not be confused with  cayenne pepper,  they are entirely different  (No. 168) ; when the stew is done and ready to serve, pour in a little  Madeira wine,  suppress the  parsley,  reduce it properly and serve.  
 
 
   FISH (Poisson).

 Bone  and prick the  meat  with a larding needle, rub it over with pulverized  saltpetre,   salt  and  brown sugar,  then put it in an earthern vessel or a wooden tub, pouring over a  brine  prepared as follows: Throw a  potato into salted water;  when it rises to the surface it is an indication that the  brine  is sufficiently strong; pour enough of this over the  meat  to cover entirely and set it in a cool place where the thermometer does not register above forty degrees, leaving it for fifteen days, and carefully turning the  meat  over at various intervals. When ready to be used, drain the  corned beef,  wash, then boil in plenty of  water.  For a six-pound piece it will take about two hours and a half. After cooking for one hour, add to it a pudding made of  flour  and  beef suet,  also  cabbage,   onions,  and pared  carrots  and  turnips.  Three-quarters of an hour before serving, throw in some medium sized peeled  potatoes ; range the  corned meat  on a dish, garnish around with the  cabbage,   carrots,   turnips,  and  onions  arranged in clusters, and at the  ends place the pudding cut into slices. Pour into the bottom of the dish a clear  gravy   (No. 404) . The quantity of  water  requisite to cook the  corned beef  depends entirely upon the quantity of  salt  used, and the length of time the  beef  was in the  brine;  if the  beef  is very salty, it will require more  water  than otherwise, and it is even advisable to change it after the first boil.  
  
  (1317). EDGEBONE OR AITCHBONE, BOILED CREAM HORSERADISH SAUCE (Quasi de B&#x153;uf bouilli Sauce Raifort &#224; la Cr&#232;me).

Cut along the vertebra and toward the top of the back a piece containing the greater part of the  tenderloin,  from the end  rib  to the hip; this part called the middle short  loin,  and is the choice piece for roasting; it is used in the best houses in England and France. The  meat  must be selected from a young and tender  beef  of deep crimson color and veined with slices of  fat.  Cut from the center a piece weighing, ten, twenty, or thirty pounds, more or less, according to the number of guests to be supplied, cut away the  fat,  and a piece of the flank  seasoning  with  salt  and  pepper,  and fold the flank over; the  meat  should be the same thickness throughout.

It suffices to place it in the middle of an English cradle spit ( Fig.  116), but sometimes it is impossible to cook it in this way. Therefore the most practical manner is to cook it as follows: Set it in a deep pan with raised edges, and furnished with a grate slightly raised on four  feet  an inch and a half high ( Fig.  306).

When nearly done  salt.  When the short  loin  is nearly cooked untie, and keep in a hot closet from fifteen to forty minutes according to the size, then serve it in a large dish; it must be cut in slices lengthwise of the  meat,  beginning at the  sirloin  and then the  tenderloin.  Serve on very hot plates with a  sauce -boat of clear  gravy   (No. 404)  passed around at the same time.

Prick the thick flank with the tip of a small knife; flatten it; remove the  skin  from the  tenderloin,  also the large nerve on the  sirloin,  trim the  loin  well, leaving the flank wider on the thin side of the  tenderloin.  Season with  salt  and  pepper,   lard  the  meat  with larding  pork  and seasoned raw  ham,  roll the flank over the  tenderloin,  covering the latter with slices of  fat  an inch or more in thickness; tie it up, making a knot at each turn of the string, which must be about three-quarters of an inch apart. Cover the bottom of a buttered braising pan with cut slices of  carrots  and  onions,  lay the  loin  on top, moisten to a quarter of its height with  broth,   (No. 194a)  and a quarter of a bottleful of Marsala  wine,  adding a quarter of a pound of sliced  mushrooms.

  (1550). THE WAY TO PREPARE SWEETBREADS (Mani&#232;re de Pr&#233;parer Les Ris de Veau).  
 Sweetbread  is a glandulous substance found below the  calf 's throat and is considered a most delicate morsel. Separate the throat  sweetbreads  from the  hearts;  the throat part is the largest of the two, the  heart  is whiter, of a round shape and more delicate and tender than the throat, place them in  cold water  to disgorge for several hours changing it each hour so as to have them very  white;  lay them in a saucepan with an abundant supply of  cold water,  set it on the fire and when the  sweetbreads  are firm to the touch or poached, or more properly speaking parboiled, then refresh and suppress all the wind-pipes, fibers and fatty parts, afterward lay them under a very light weight. This blanching is for the purpose of hardening the  sweetbreads  so as to be able to  lard  them more easily. Blanched  sweetbreads  are used for saut&#233;ing by cutting them in two through their thickness. For brochettes they are cut in slices and for garnishing in the shape of salpicon.

Turn it inside out in such a way that the fatty part is inside; in order to accomplish this easily, take a stick a yard long, place the end of it in three inches of the narrowest end of the pipe and run the pipe entirely on the stick, keeping it all the time in its original place; when it is all on let slide by pulling it slowly on the first part, that is on the stick, and the pipe will turn over all alone. Now clean it in luke- warm water  acidulated with  vinegar,  changing it three times and leave to soak for three hours; rub it once more through the hands so as to remove all the remaining gluey parts. Put aside the uncrimped part of the pipe which will answer for wrapping purposes and set the remainder in a pot full of  cold water;  heat until the pipe becomes a little  hard,  not letting it boil. Afterward cut the pipe lengthwise, lay it perfectly flat spread it out and clean it thoroughly; cut it into thin strips as long as possible without separating the parts. Cut also into the same lengths the crimped part of a  calf 's crow suppressing the  fat  center. Cut up about a pound and a half of  salt pork  into strips. Now lay all these out on a table in the proportion of two-thirds of the bowels and the other third composed of crow and throat  fat;  dress in oblong shape, being careful that the left side has the least possible loose ends; the size to be about eight to nine strips. Season this laid out part with a minced  seasoning  composed of three  onions,  three  shallots,  half a handful of very finely chopped  parsley,   pepper,   allspice,   nutmeg  and mignonette, strewing it over the whole. Pass a strap made of two six inch lengths of birchwood fastened together with an inch length of string through the opening on the left end, and turn it in such a way that the chitterling has the appearance of a twisted cable. Cut the pipes laid aside for wrapping purposes into sixteen inch lengths, have the fatty part outside, operating the same as when turning over the  gut  itself, placing the  gut  one inch below the hole; run the chitterling through, being careful to keep the first end at the extremity of the chitterling; tie both ends. Although this may appear very easy, yet it is a difficult operation to perform for the first time and requires a certain practice.   To Cook the Chitterlings.  -To have them very  white,  cook in a  stock  of half  milk,  half  water,  one  onion,   thyme,   bay leaf,   salt  and  lemon;  leave to boil slowly for about three hours. In order to give a finer appearance, restuff the chitterling after the first cooking in an uncrimped pipe and leave on a slow fire for fifteen minutes, keeping it near boiling point. Now lay it in a napkin and press between two boards with weights on top or else in the press ( Fig.  71); the chitterlings will be square-shaped.   To Broil.  -Score the chitterlings on both sides about three-sixteenths of an inch in depth, baste with  oil  or  butter,  broil on a slow fire and dress on a dish over a little clear  gravy   (No. 404) .

  (1791). HAM WITH SPINACH -BOILED  (Jambon Bouilli aux &#201;pinards).  
Take a fine freshly salted,  smoked ham,  pare the  meats  also the  fat,  which should be exceedingly  white;  suppress the hip  bone,  saw off the knuckle  bone  and then unsalt the  ham  in a plentiful supply of  water  for twenty-four hours. If it should have been dried and salted for some time prior to the day of using, then it will require thirty-six hours of unsalting. Wash, drain and tie it in a towel. Five hours before serving lay it in a large braziere or soup pot with four times its volume of  cold water,  adding four quartered  carrots,  two  onions  containing six  cloves,  a bunch of  parsley  garnished with  thyme,   bay leaf,   basil  and  mace,  then let it boil and simmer slowly for four hours more or less, according to the weight and size of the  ham,  calculating a quarter of an hour for each pound. To be assured that it is properly cooked, run the tip of a skewer into the flesh and if it can be withdrawn at once the  ham  is sufficiently done. Remove the braziere or pot from the fire half an hour before serving; drain the  ham  on a dish, take off the towel and pare the  rind  and  fat  tastefully; clean the handle  bone  thoroughly cutting off the  meat  for about two and a half inches from the end, then set it in the oven to dry the surface.

  (1792). VIRGINIA HAM WITH STRINGED EGGS  (Jambon de Virginie aux (&#x152;ufs Fil&#233;s). 
This dish is a favorite one among Spanish people. Select the  ham  from a young  pig,  pare and cook it the same as the boiled  ham  with  spinach   (No. 1791) ; when done, drain and cut off the  rind,  pare the upper surface evenly, and wipe the  fat  over with a cloth, besprinkle with a thin layer of  powdered sugar  and glaze it either under a salamander ( Fig.  123) or in a very hot oven. Trim the handle with a frill ( No. 10)  and dress on a low, carved  rice  socle, placed on a long dish. Break sixteen fresh  eggs,  place the  yolks  in a bowl and pound them without beating, then rub them through a strainer, and to poach them resemble coarse  vermicelli;  for this result it is necessary to have an oblong, wide-mouthed strainer, its aperture being six inches long by three wide and two inches and a half deep; the bottom must be furnished with six tin tubes shaped like a socket, having an opening at the bottom an eighth of an inch or less wide and soldered on the outside. Have a    sugar  pan of sufficient size and half full of twelve degrees hot  syrup;  keep the strainer on top of this boiling  syrup,  and pour the strained  eggs  into it, letting them fall through into the  syrup;  as quickly as they harden lift them out and spread in a sieve dampened with  water,  so that these strings do not adhere to one another, then dress them around the  ham.   Madeira sauce   (No. 492)  may be served separately.
